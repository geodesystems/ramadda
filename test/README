tclsh fetchurls.tcl *.txt
or:
tclsh fetchurls.tcl -loop <some file with a list of URLs>


runuitest.tcl:
This runs through most of the pages at https://ramadda.org/repository/a/examples,
brings up the page in Safari, pauses for some number of seconds to allow the page to render, and captures the image.
A file is generated: uiimages.html

A way to check for JS errors is to bring up the web console in Safari. This is captured in the image.

To run:
mkdir results
cd results
tclsh ../runuitest.tcl

This will only call up the page if the corresponding image thumb_<page name>.png does not exist. So to do a full test:
rm thumb_*
