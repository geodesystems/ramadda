#
#This is an example language translation file. All of the phrases below were
#extracted from the RAMADDA source code.
#
#RAMADDA looks in the org/ramadda/repository/resources/languages package for
#any file that ends with ".pack". It then looks in the repository plugins directory
#for any .pack files. So, rename this file, (e.g., sp.pack) copy it to your plugins and put your 
#translations in it below. If you see a phrase in RAMADDA that is not getting translated
#just send a note about it to the developers. 
#
#The following 2 lines define the id of the language and its name
#Change them for your language

language.id=example
language.name=Example Language 

#
# To set a language as the default language for the entire site
# define the following property in your local repository.properties file or
# in the Admin->Site and Contact Information -> Extra Properties section
#
# ramadda.language.default=example
#

#
#Here is where you do the translation
#.e.g:
#Phrase used in RAMADDA=Your translation
#If you don't have a translation then RAMADDA will just use the English phrase
