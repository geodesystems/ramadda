To run this from the command line do:

    sh ramaddaclient.sh

This will print out the command line arguments

To do a search do:

sh ramaddaclient.sh <authentication info> -search  arg1   value1 arg2 value2 ... argN valueN

Where the argN are the search url args that you can specify in an advanced search:
http://ramadda.org/repository/search/form

For now this prints out the entry xml to the stdout.
