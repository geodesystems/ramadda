##This properties file allows you to configure your RAMADDA installation
##Rename this file as repository.properties and keep it in the WEB-INF directory.
##
##The minimal thing you need to do here is to define the ramadda_home property
##to point to the directory that RAMADDA uses to look for further properties
##files, resources and the place it writes data files, etc.
##An alternative way to to define ramadda_home is as an environment variable
##of the tomcat process.
