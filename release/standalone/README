Java
###################################################################
RAMADDA requires Java 1.8 or above to run.


###################################################################
Initial setup on Un*x systems
###################################################################
Here is the recommended setup to run RAMADDA stand-alone.
Create a ramadda directory to hold the @RELEASE@ release 
and copy the ramaddaenv.sh file from the release directory
to the ramadda directory. 

Looks like:
ramadda
      @RELEASE@
      ramaddaenv.sh

The ramaddaenv.sh gets sourced and contains
the location of Java and the ports that RAMADDA should run on.
This way when you reinstall RAMADDA the local configuration
does not get lost. Edit the copied ramaddaenv.sh to point to
where Java is located, what port to run RAMADDA on and the location
of the RAMADDA home directory.

To run RAMADDA just do:

   sh @RELEASE@/ramadda.sh

By default this  will run RAMADDA on port HTTP 8080 with the RAMADDA
home directory (where it stores everything) set to
<user home>/.ramadda and will use a local Java Derby database.

See the Configuration section below for more details but an easy way to 
change these settings is with command line arguments:

    sh @RELEASE@/ramadda.sh -port 8081 -Dramadda_home=/some/other/directory/ramadda

See the Database section below on how to change the database

You need to complete the configuration at:
http://localhost:8080/repository

For more information see:
http://ramadda.org/repository/userguide/installing.html


###################################################################
RAMADDA Home Directory
###################################################################
RAMADDA, on both Unix, Mac or Windows, requires a home directory where it creates
the database, saves files, etc. There is documentation here:
https://ramadda.org/repository/userguide/installing.html

You will need to create this directory. By default RAMADDA looks for:
<user home directory>/.ramadda

You can override the home directory (see below or in ramadda.bat) a number of ways.

You can set the environment variable:
RAMADDA_HOME=/some/other/directory/ramadda

You can set the environment variable with the Java command line argument:
-DRAMADDA_HOME=/some/other/directory/ramadda 

Or pass in a regular  command line argument to RAMADDA:
-home /some/other/directory/ramadda 

When RAMADDA first starts up it writes an install.properties file that contains an
install password and prints out this password to stdout.
ramadda.install.password=<some password>

You will need this password when doing the final web-based  RAMADDA configuration


###################################################################
Running as a service in the background
###################################################################

For Un*x systems the script @RELEASE@/ramaddaService.sh can start, stop and
restart a running RAMADDA process in the background. This should be used when
running RAMADDA as a regular server.

This runs with:
sh ramaddaService.sh start
sh ramaddaService.sh stop
sh ramaddaService.sh restart
sh ramaddaService.sh status


For Windows it looks like running the Non-Sucking Service Manager
is an easy way to set up RAMADDA as a service.

It appears that you can specify environment variables and command line arguments
through the service



###################################################################
Configuration
###################################################################

The ramadda.sh script runs the stand-alone version of RAMADDA.
The script uses the environment variables:
RAMADDA_HOME - The directory RAMADDA stores everything in.  Defaults to <user home>/.ramadda

RAMADDA_PORT - The port that RAMADDA runs on. Defaults to 8080 or 80 in windows

JAVA - Path to the Java executable. Defaults to "java"
For windows this checks for JAVA_HOME where java is at:
%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java

If not set by the calling process the script sets the RAMADDA_HOME, 
RAMADDA_PORT  and JAVA variables to the defaults then runs the ramaddaenv.sh 
in the release directory.  Then, if it exists, the script execs ramaddaenv.sh
in the parent directory of the release directory.


###################################################################
Plugins
###################################################################
When you start RAMADDA it will create a plugins directory under the RAMADDA
home directory. During the web-based initialization you can choose  to install
the following plugins. It is recommended to install all of the plugins (except the
bioplugins). They pretty much just provide different entry types
coreplugins: 
geoplugins: Lots of geoscience related data and services
miscplugins:
bioplugins: bioscience data

There are some other plugin files available via ramadda.org (https://ramadda.org/repository/alias/release/)
which you can install in the plugins directory.

When you re-install a new version of RAMADDA any plugins you have installed previously
will get updated.



###################################################################
Database
###################################################################
By default this uses the built-in Java Derby database. Derby is quite 
capable but it lacks certain features and might not be as performant
as other databases.

If you want to use a different database (e.g., mysql, postgres, oracle, H2) see:
http://ramadda.org/repository/userguide/database.html
