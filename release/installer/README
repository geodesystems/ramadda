########################################
install.sh - Installs RAMADDA for an Amazon Linux and other Linuxes (tested on Ubuntu, Redhat and Centos). It only installs PostGRES on Amazon Linux

Run as:
sudo sh ramaddainstaller/install.sh

This will -
Setup the directories
On Amazon Linux install and configure Postgres
Create a self-signed SSL certificate
Install RAMADDA as a service


Once the installer is run go to:
https://<your IP address>
to complete the RAMADDA configuration

Once RAMADDA is installed there are a number of other configuration options that can
be configured. See https://ramadda.org/repository/userguide/configuration.html


########################################
## RAMADDA Service
########################################
On Amazon Linux to start/stop RAMADDA:
sudo service ramadda stop
sudo  service ramadda start

On other Linuxes
sudo systemctl start ramadda
sudo systemctl stop ramadda


########################################
## Updating RAMADDA
########################################
To update RAMADDA:
sudo sh ramaddainstaller/update.sh

To update RAMADDA with the latest development release:
sudo sh ramaddainstaller/update.sh -dev

This downloads the ramaddaserver.zip from:
https://ramadda.org/release


########################################
## Main disk and directories
########################################

The main storage volume is mounted at /mnt/ramadda
This is the only disk that needs to be backed up (in the AWS console)

The RAMADDA home directory is at:
/mnt/ramadda/ramaddahome/
This is where the data files are stored, etc

The PostGRES database is stored at:
/mnt/ramadda/pgsql

The RAMADDA server software is installed at:
/mnt/ramadda/ramaddainstall/


########################################
## RAMADDA properties
########################################
RAMADDA needs to have some properties defined, e.g., paths to programs,
API keys, etc. This is done by editing the file:
/mnt/ramadda/ramaddahome/repository.properties

The ssl.properties file is generated and holds the password and keypassword
/mnt/ramadda/ramaddahome/ssl.properties



########################################
## RAMADDA plugins
########################################

RAMADDA uses plugins to add functionality. All of the plugins are stored in:
/mnt/ramadda/ramaddahome/plugins

When updating RAMADDA the core plugins are also updated. If you have non-core
plugins copy them to this directory and restart RAMADDA



########################################
## https certificate
########################################
The installer will create a self-signed SSL certificate to enable the initial RAMADDA install.
You will need to accept the security warning in the browser.

As a convenience the installer also has a letsencrypt.sh script that supports using
letsencrypt.org to create a real certificate. You can run this with
sudo sh ramaddainstaller/letsencrypt.sh  -help

The  letsencrypt certificate needs to be renewed every 3 months. To renew it do:
sudo sh ramaddainstaller/letsencrypt.sh  -renew ...

You can also use:
sudo sh ramaddainstaller/renewcertificate.sh

This is a wrapper that uses a DOMAIN environment variable set in .bashrc
export DOMAIN=yourdomain.org

and  calls:
sudo sh  sh ramaddainstaller/letsencrypt.sh  -renew -domain ${DOMAIN}

renewcertificate.sh logs its output to:
ramaddainstaller/certificate.log

You can also run this as a cron job. Consult renewcertificate.sh for instructions
