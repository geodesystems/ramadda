##### installer.sh #####

The installer.sh configures a machine and installs RAMADDA. It has been tested
on Amazon Linux but not on other distributions.

Set up an Amazon instance (see below), download the RAMADDA installer on to the instance then run it as:

    sudo sh /home/ec2-user/ramaddainstaller/installer.sh 

Make sure to give it the absolute path!


This will walk you through a number of installation steps to setup the directories, and install and configure Postgres and RAMADDA

To start and stop RAMADDA do:
    sudo sh ramaddaserver/ramaddaService.sh stop|start|restart


To update an installation first get the latest version of the ramaddaserver.zip from Geode Systems - 
   http://geodesystems.com/repository/alias/release/

Copy it into this ramaddainstall directory then run update.sh with the full path, e.g.:
   sudo sh /home/ec2-user/ramaddainstaller/update.sh



##### awscli.sh #####

The awscli.sh uses the Amazon Command Line Interface (http://aws.amazon.com/cli) to provision a new server and then it runs the RAMADDA installer. 

First, create an instance as detailed below and get the instance ID.  

After installing the Amazon CLI on your desktop machine (not your server) run: 

   sh awscli.sh <instance ID>

Notes for setting up an Amazon instance through the EC2 web console

1) Create an Amazon AWS account. 

2) From the EC2 Dashboard go to the  Instances page and select  Launch Instance
Choose the standard  Amazon Linux AMI and select the machine type

3) Create a security group with the following ports:

HTTP port 80
HTTPS port 443
SSH  port 22

Optionally open FTP: 
Custom TCP Rule port 21  
Custom TCP Rule port range 44001 - 44099


4) Add a Storage Volume. 
Normally, the instance has a smallish volume. This is where /home is mounted. You can add an extra 
volume that holds the the database, the RAMADDA home directory and any data you may have. The size depends 
on how much data and content you plan to have on your RAMADDA. 100 GB is more than plenty for normal RAMADDA 
use. Note the device, e.g., /dev/sdb. This often will show up on the machine as /dev/xvdb. 

5) Download the PEM file
When you Launch the instance create and save a .pem file. This is what you use to access your server. The permissions on the pem file need to be 400, e.g.:

   chmod 400 ramadda.pem

6) Configure your server

#SSH to the machine
ssh -i <.pem file>  ec2-user@<server IP address>

See the README to finish the ramadda install
