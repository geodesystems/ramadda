Custom JAR files in the lib directory:

jfreechart.jar:
Note: for now I (jeffmc) fixed s ticky bug in AbstractXYItemRenderer where it passed in 
NaN coordinates. This caused some JVMs to never return from the java2d draw call.
I will submit the fix to the jfreechart folks but for now we're good (I think)

javax.jar:
This was some old javax components that were originally in the giant IDV external.jar

ij.jar: The iamgej from the IDV

ramadda.jar:
This is the compiled code. We have it in lib so other packages can link to it

ramaddalib.jar:
  This holds all of the 3rd party libs  used by ramadda. It is made
  with the ant target ramaddalib in src/org/ramadda/repository


ramaddatds.jar:
  This gets built from the THREDDS TDS war file, ncIdv.jar and 
  unidatacommon.jar.

  To build this:

  - Get the latest thredds.war from the Unidata FTP site, e.g:
    ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/thredds/4.2/current/thredds.war

  - Because thredds.war might not be as up to date as the classes used in IDV,
  also get the latest ncIdv.jar and unidatacommon.jar from the IDV 
  git repository (see below)

  Now run the tcl script:
    tclsh ../bin/makethredds.tcl

  This unjars the war and unjars certain jars and makes repositorytds.jar

ramaddatika.jar:
ramaddatika.jar is generated running tclsh maketika.tcl
this uzips the  tika-app-2.1.0.jar  and removes a bunch
of conflicting dependencies including:
com/google
dods
ucar
thredds
org/apache/logging
org/slf4j
org/apache/http
com/drew 
org/joda



idv.jar:
This contains a modified JythonManager.class file

ncIdv.jar:
  This should be the definitive source of the netcdf package. It gets
  included in both the repositorytds.jar and the repositorylib.jar.
  We do this because other packages have netcdf in it (e.g., visad.jar).
  This can be retrieved from the IDV github repository:

     http://github.com/Unidata/IDV

ncIdv.jar:
  This is common code that was supposed to be shared between IDV and 
  netCDF-java.  Unfortunately, netCDF-Java has it's own version of these
  classes which are not kept up to date with the unidatacommon.jar
  classes.  So, we need to unpack this on top of the thredds.war.
  In netCDF-Java 4.3, this will no longer be necessary as it has 
  sucked in the ucar.unidata.geoloc package and the ucar.unidata.util
  classes are back in idv.jar

visad.jar:
  Note: the version used in RAMADDA has been unjarred, had the top-level 
  nom package removed, and rejarred.  The original jar has an old version 
  of the nom package (for fits data) and was screwing up the 
  org/ramadda/geodata/fits plugin

jetty.jar:
This is version 9.4.55

This is the combination of the following all the jetty modules:
    jetty-<module>-<version>.jar

See the file <root>/bin/unjarjetty.tcl


abom.jar:
This holds the Barnes analysis code from the IDV release


These jars are from the java faker package - https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker
which supports data anonymization
automaton-1.11-8.jar
generex-1.0.2.jar
javafaker-1.0.2.jar
snakeyaml-1.23-android.jar



log4j-core-2.15.0.jar:
This is updated with the log4j rce exploit but for good measure we deleted
org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class


jmapproj.jar:

  This comes from http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmapprojlib/ and
  is a Java implementation of the proj4 library.  It is used in the
  lidar package for doing coordinate transforms.

junit.jar:

  https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/downloads This is from junit-4.10.jar

h2.jar:
This is the H2 database jar.  Original version h2-1.3.167.jar  


ezid.jar:
This was built from  https://github.com/mbjones/ezid

  This work was created by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and
  Synthesis at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB).
  Copyright 2011 Regents of the University of California
 
jsbeautify.jar
This was built from https://github.com/belgampaul/JsBeautifier.git

  took the js.jar from the lib directory and updated it with the compiled JsBeautifier
  beautify.js.

json.jar:
This is from the JSON in Java project http://www.json.org/java/index.html
https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java



fuzzywuzzy-1.3.0.jar:
provides fuzzy text search
from: https://github.com/xdrop/fuzzywuzzy
