To build the boreholeplugin.jar just run ant:
ant

this will create the plugin in <top dir>/dist/otherplugins and copy it to your local RAMADDA plugins directory.

Any icons or other content  can be placed in the htdocs/borehole directory and referenced as /borehole/...


The file types.xml (or any file ending in "types.xml") defines new entry types. 
The file metadata.xml (or any file ending in "metadata.xml") defines some example metadata types.  There are lots of other examples in the other plugins. Look in ../fieldproject/resources

If you get too many files in this dir you can create a sub dir (e.g., resources) to put things in.
