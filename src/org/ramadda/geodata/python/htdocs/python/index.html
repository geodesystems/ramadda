<h2>Rendering Notebooks</h2>
RAMADDA will render a notebook file. It does a pretty good job but not as good as the Jupyter rendering. If you have jupyter installed on the server you have RAMADDA running on you can configure RAMADDA to use the Juptyer rendering.

To do this just set a property in some .properties file in your RAMADDA home dir:
<pre>
ramadda.jupyter.path=/path/to/jupyter
</pre>
