This is a set of utilities used for data wrangling files

########################################
Site Entry Types
########################################

The file siteramadda.xml is used to tell define the RAMADDA  entry type for directories that represent "sites".

This file needs to be renamed to .ramadda.xml and copied into the project directory. 
For example, the file:

 /archive/projects/Antarctica/B-504-Dry_Valleys_Ice_and_Rock_Glaciers/.ramadda.xml

will get read and applied to any entry that is created for the other directories, e.g.:
B-504_Canada_Glacier_Basin/
B-504_Canada_Glacier_Cliff/
B-504_Lake_Hoare_Watermarks/



########################################
Point Cloud Data
########################################

When RAMADDA ingests point data it needs to know the format of the files, 
their fields, coordinate systems, etc.

This metadata is defined in a point.properties file in the same directory as the data file. 
 
resources/ecefpoint.properties
resources/latlonpoint.properties

These files define the field delimiter, fields, crs and how many header lines to skip . The formats of these files is documented at:
http://ramadda.org/repository/pointdocs/dataformats.html

Copy (and possibly modify) the appropriate properties file to the directory that contains your point cloud data

On the TLS machine you can run a file checker from the command line before it gets ingested into RAMADDA. 
cd <data directory>
Run the script:
<dev>/pointtools/pointbounds.sh <lidar file>

On thump2 we need to upgrade java to 1.6 to run these scripts


########################################
Changing Permissions
########################################
When files are moved to the main archive area they should have their permissions set as read only

run:
sudo sh <bin>/changepermissions.sh

sudo chmod 444 `find  . -type f`
sudo chmod 555 `find  . -type d`
