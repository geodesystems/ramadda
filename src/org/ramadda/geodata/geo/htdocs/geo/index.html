RAMADDA provides a number of entry types in support of borehole geology.
-callout

:heading Data Types
RAMADDA provides support for the following entry types-
* <a href="#geo_project">Geo Project</a> - Defines project metadata
* <a href="#geo_site">Geo Site</a> - A site location
* <a href="boreholeimages.html">Geo Image Collection</a> - A collection of borehole images. Provides an interactive visual display and integrated chart displays.
* <a href="boreholeimages.html#core_images">Geo Core Image</a> - A core image. Can be depth referenced and displayed in an image collection
* <a href="#log_ascii_standard">Log ASCII Standard (LAS)</a>  - Standard text log file
* <a href="#borehole_log_files">Borehole Log File</a> - Standard text log file
* <a href="#digital_log_interchange_standard_dlis">Digital Log Interchange Standard (DLIS)</a> - A binary format. 
* Multi-Sensor Core Logging - USGS <a href=https://cmgds.marine.usgs.gov/data/geotech/logger.html>file format</a>
* WellCAD Log File - A binary format. 
* Core XRF File - 
* Borehole Lithology  - A semi-custom CSV format for lithology at depths
* <a href=boreholeimages.html#breeze_core_images>Geo Breeze XML</a>   - This is the XML metadata file from  Prediktera Breeze Software


:heading Geo Project
The Geo Project entry type serves as a container of Geo Sites and other data and content
(e.g. documents) and provides a default web display of this material.
Here is an example Geo Project for the 
<a href=https://ramadda.org/repository/a/borehole_southern_newark>Newark Basin Coring Project</a>
:p
{{image screenshot=true align=center src=/geo/docs/geoproject.png bordercolor=#ccc}}
:p

To create a Geo Project:
* Navigate to some folder on your RAMADDA repository
* Under the Entry popup menu choose "Pick a type..."
* Search for "Geo Project" and select the Geo Project entry type
* Enter a name and optionally a  description and a date range

By default a number of children entries will be added to a Geo  Project-
* Sites  - a Map Folder entry to hold project sites
* Documents - a Document Collection to hold documents
* Private - a folder that has been configured to restrict access to its data and contents.


To add images (like above):
* Go to the Entry popup menu of the Geo Project
* Under Edit select Add Thumbnail Image

Under the entry popup menu you can also add one or more metadata properties for:
* Principal Investigator
* Funding Information
* Project Personnnel
* Use Constraints
* Citation
* A RAMADDA alias

Once added any of these metadata properties can be edited from the Edit-&gt;Edit Properties page.


:heading Geo Site
The Geo Project can contain one or more Geo Sites. These are also special purpose folders
and are meant to hold site specific data collections. e.g.-
:p
{{image screenshot=true align=center src=/geo/docs/geosite.png bordercolor=#ccc}}
:p

A Geo Site entry can be added anywhere but to keep your content organized you should add the
sites under the Geo Project's "Sites" Map Folder entry.
* From the Sites entry choose "Pick a type..." from the Entry popup File menu 
* Search for Geo Site (note: once a Geo Site has been added then the entry type will show up in the File menu)
* A Geo Site has a name, description and a latitude/longitude

+callout-info
Note: Many of the Borehole data types will automatically inherit the geolocation of a Geo Site.
-callout


You can add any data files, folder entries, etc to the Geo Site. If you have  collections of
data it is recommended that you create the appropriate entry types-
* Folder - for a general collection that does not require special purpose display
* Point Data Collection - This provides an interactive display for entries which charts, etc., e.g. Borehole Log Files
* Geo Image Collection - for borehole images. See <a href=boreholeimages.html>boreholeimages.html</a> for more information.


:heading Borehole Images
See <a href=boreholeimages.html>boreholeimages.html</a>

:heading Log ASCII Standard
RAMADDA supports the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_ASCII_standard>Log ASCII Standard</a>
borehole log file format.
To create an LAS entry go to the folder you want to add to (e.g., a Point Data Collection):
* From the Entry popup menu choose "Pick a type..."
* Search for "log ascii" and select the Log ASCII Standard entry type
* Upload your file

When created metadata will be extracted from the file and a default data display will be shown as below. If the LAS entry is added somewhere under a Geo Site and the Geo Site has a geolocation
then the latitude/longitude of the Geo Site will be applied to the LAS entry type and a map will
be shown.

To do a bulk upload of LAS files just create a .zip file and upload the zip file instead of
the indindividual file  as described above.



:heading Borehole Log Files
The RAMADDA "Borehole Log File" entry type supports text borehole log files of the form:
+pre
SITE:	Martinsville
PROJECT:	Newark Basin
TOP:	2.000
BOTTOM:	4002.000

DEPTH	TEMP2	TEMP1
ft	degC	degC
2.000	6.046	19.360
4.000	5.995	19.104
...
-pre

:heading Digital Log Interchange Standard (DLIS)
This is a  binary file format. RAMADDA provides no services other than basic metadata and
file access. (<a href=https://dlisio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dlis/specification.html>Specification</a>).


:heading Multi-Sensor Core Logging
A USGS <a href=https://cmgds.marine.usgs.gov/data/geotech/logger.html>file format</a>.


:heading Borehole Lithology
This is a custom CSV file format for defining lithology - color, grain size and depth description.
It takes the form:
+pre
depth,color,grain size,depth rank
309,0,1,0
311.6,0,1,0
312.2,0,1,0
322,0,1,0
...
-pre

The display is:
