RAMADDA provides a number of entry types in support of borehole geology.
-callout

:heading Geo Project
The Geo Project entry type serves as a container of Geo Sites and other data and content
(e.g. documents) and provides a default web display of this material.
Here is an example Geo Project for the 
<a href=https://ramadda.org/repository/a/borehole_southern_newark>Newark Basin Coring Project</a>
:p

:p

To create a Geo Project:
* Navigate to some folder on your RAMADDA repository
* Under the Entry popup menu choose "Pick a type..."
* Search for "Geo Project" and select the Geo Project entry type
* Enter a name and optionally a  description and a date range

By default a number of children entries will be added to a Geo  Project-
* Sites  - a Map Folder entry to hold project sites
* Documents - a Document Collection to hold documents
* Private - a folder that has been configured to restrict access to its data and contents.


To add images (like above):
* Go to the Entry popup menu of the Geo Project
* Under Edit select Add Thumbnail Image

Under the entry popup menu you can also add one or more metadata properties for:
* Principal Investigator
* Funding Information
* Project Personnnel
* Use Constraints
* Citation
* A RAMADDA alias

Once added any of these metadata properties can be edited from the Edit-&gt;Edit Properties page.


:heading Geo Site
The Geo Project can contain one or more Geo Sites. These are also special purpose folders
and are meant to hold site specific data collections. e.g.-

:p

A Geo Site entry can be added anywhere but to keep your content organized you should add the
sites under the Geo Project's "Sites" Map Folder entry.
* From the Sites entry choose "Pick a type..." from the Entry popup File menu 
* Search for Geo Site (note: once a Geo Site has been added then the entry type will show up in the File menu)
* A Geo Site has a name, description and a latitude/longitude

+callout-info
Note: Many of the Borehole data types will automatically inherit the geolocation of a Geo Site.

You can add any data files, folder entries, etc to the Geo Site. If you have  collections of
data it is recommended that you create the appropriate entry types-
* Folder - for a general collection that does not require special purpose display
* Point Data Collection - This provides an interactive display for entries which charts, etc., e.g. Borehole Log Files
* Geo Image Collection - for borehole images. See <a href=boreholeimages.html>boreholeimages.html</a> for more information.


:heading Borehole Images
See <a href=boreholeimages.html>boreholeimages.html</a>

:heading Log ASCII Standard
RAMADDA supports the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_ASCII_standard>Log ASCII Standard</a>
borehole log file format.
To create an LAS entry go to the folder you want to add to (e.g., a Point Data Collection):
* From the Entry popup menu choose "Pick a type..."
* Search for "log ascii" and select the Log ASCII Standard entry type
* Upload your file

When created metadata will be extracted from the file and a default data display will be shown as below. If the LAS entry is added somewhere under a Geo Site and the Geo Site has a geolocation
then the latitude/longitude of the Geo Site will be applied to the LAS entry type and a map will
be shown.

To do a bulk upload of LAS files just create a .zip file and upload the zip file instead of
the indindividual file  as described above.



:heading Borehole Log Files
The RAMADDA "Borehole Log File" entry type supports text borehole log files of the form:
