RAMADDA provides a Core Visualizer  facility that displays one or more
core images and their associated depths.
-callout

:heading Geo Image Collection
Multiple core images can be displayed under a Geo Image Collection. To create:
* Navigate to some area on your RAMADDA repository.
* From the Entry popup menu choose "Pick a type..."
* From the big list of entry types search for "Geo Image" and select the "Geo Image Collection" entry type
* Create the new entry

The Geo Image Collection acts as a Folder under which the Geo Core Image files can be added.


:heading Core Images
Any image can be uploaded as a Geo Core Image entry.
* From the Geo Image Collection entry popup menu choose "Geo Core Image".
* Note - you can upload a Core Image anywhere. Just choose "Pick a type..." and search for "Geo Core Image"
* Upload the image. Optionally you can manually specify a top and bottom depth.
* By default the Core Visualizer will be displayed. You can not display it by setting the  Show Visualizer setting to No


:heading  Breeze Core Images
RAMADDA provides special support for importing a collection of Core images and ancillary metadata
from the Prediktera Breeze analysis package. There are two ways to do this - single files and
importing a .zip file.

:heading2 Adding Single Files
* From the Geo Image Collection entry go to the Entry popup menu and select "Geo Core Image".
* From the new Geo Core Image form upload your core image. You can change the name of the entry, etc.
* From the new Core Image entry popup menu choose "Geo Breeze XML" and upload the metadata.xml file
* The depth and resolution metadata should be extracted from the XML file and added to the Core Image entry

:heading2 Adding Multiple Files 
To upload multiple image files along with their respective XML files
create a .zip file (e.g. core.zip) of the images and metadata. The .zip file
should be of the form:
+pre
228/
228/measurement.jpg
228/measurement.xml
229/
229/measurement.jpg
229/measurement.xml
230/
230/measurement.jpg
230/measurement.xml
...
-pre

From the Geo Image Collection entry go to the Entry Import menu and specify the .zip file.
:br
Under "Type" select Borehole Core Images:
:br
<img src=docs/importcoreimages.png width=500px>
:br

This results in the following entry structure. Each of the image files will be
added as a  Geo Core Image  entry and renamed with its
zip directory name. Each of the measurement.xml files will be added as a Geo Breeze XML  file.
When viewing the core image entry the depth registration from the XML file should be shown.
