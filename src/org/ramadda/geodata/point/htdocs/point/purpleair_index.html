<center><h2>Purple Air Data</h2></center>

:navtop

:p
:lheading Configuring the API
Sensor data from Purple Air sensors can be read and displayed in RAMADDA.
The data is provided by Purple Air through their <a href="https://api.purpleair.com/">API</a> and requires an API key. To 
get the key send a request to <a mailto:contact@purpleair.com>contact@purpleair.com</a>. Once you have the key add a 
property to your repository.properties file (in the RAMADDA home directory) and restart your RAMADDA.
<pre>
purpleair.api.key=key here
</pre>

The default frequency for fetching data is  every 15 minutes. This can be changed with a property
in repository.properties:
<pre>
purpleair.frequency=15
</pre>


With the API key specified RAMADDA will periodically access the API for each Purple Air entry
you have created and append the  current data to a local CSV file in RAMADDA. 
This file can be downloaded from the sensor entry page.
Over time these files can grow to be quite large (depending on the API fetch frequency).
The default display only shows the most recent 20000 records.
You can clear out the entire file for an sensor entry
through the Clear File menu item.

:p
:lheading Creating Purple Air Entries
Once the API key is configured you can create new Purple Air Sensor entries. Go to the RAMADDA folder you want
to add the entries to and from the entry popup menu select "Pick a Type...". From the list under Geoscience/Point Data select
"Purple Air Sensor". The only field you need to specify is the Sensor ID. The ID is a numeric ID and should be able to be accessed
through your Purple Air account.
:p
Alternatively, you can access IDs for any public sensor from the map at <a href="https://map.purpleair.com/">https://map.purpleair.com/</a>. Click  on the sensor of interest and you should see the below popup.
Hover over the "Get This widget" link to see the ID in the embed HTML, e.g. 112686, or in the Download Data link.

:p

When a new Purple Air Sensor entry is created RAMADDA will fetch the metadata for the sensor, 
e.g. name, location, model, etc.   If the sensor is a private sensor you can enter the private 
key when creating the entry. The private key is available through your Purple Air account.
  You can also add your private   key as a RAMADDA property in a .properties file on your 
server. Specify your the property ID as the private key in the entry. For example, if you 
had a private key "some_private_key" then, in a repository.properties file enter:
<pre>
myprivatekey=some_private_key
</pre>    

The name of the property, e.g.,  "myprivatekey", is arbitrary. Now, when you create the Purple Air
entry in RAMADDA in the private key field just entry "myprivatekey".
<p>

The default display for a Purple Air Sensor entry is shown below. Note, initially there is no data but over time the data will be fetched from the API. 
<center><img border=1 src=purpleair/purpleair_entry.png width=600></center>
:p
If you want to stop fetching then, go the Edit page for the entry  and set Active to No.

:p
:lheading Select Fields
The <a href="https://api.purpleair.com/#api-sensors-get-sensor-data">Purple Air API</a>
provides a large number of sensor fields. The Purple Air RAMADDA entry allows you to select
one of two sets of fields - Short or All.
:p
+callout-warning
Note: if you change which fields are being collected than the data file that is created
needs to be reset so that the file contains all of the same fields. To do this go the Purple Air
RAMADDA entry and select "Clear File" from the entry menu. This will delete the existing file
and create a new one with the new set of field identifiers.

The Short list is the basic set of environmental fields:
<pre>
humidity

</pre>

The All list includes all of the available fields:

:lheading Creating a map view
There are 2 ways to show a map of Purple Air sensor entries.
Assuming you have a folder that holds the entries of interest (e.g., Test Purple Air)
the default display of that folder will look like:
<center><img border=1 src=purpleair/purpleairlist.png width=600></center>

To have the folder just show a map go and edit the folder, click on the "wiki display" checkbox, and enter the below
wiki text.
<center><img border=1 src=purpleair/wikiedit.png width=600></center>

This will give a map view of the children entries:
<center><img border=1 src=purpleair/purpleairmap.png width=600></center>


A richer map display can be created with the 
<a href="../userguide/imdv.html">Integrated Map Data Viewer (IMDV)</a> display component.
In another folder go to the <i>File-&gt;Pick a Type...</i> menu and look for "Integrated Map Data"
under the GIS Data list.
:p
Once created select "Multi Entry" under the New menu:
<center><img border=1 src=purpleair/imdvnew.png></center>

Choose the folder that holds your Purple Air sensor entries. You should
end up with something like:
<center><img border=1 src=purpleair/imdv1.png width=600></center>

Click on the <i class="fas fa-cog" style="color:#ccc;"></i> icon to bring up the
settings dialog, select "Show entry data" and press OK
<center><img border=1 src=purpleair/imdv2.png width=600></center>

The Purple Air entries in the map will now show a color-coded circle with the
latest PM2.5 measure:
<center><img border=1 src=purpleair/imdv3.png width=600></center>
