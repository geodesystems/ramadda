:heading SOFAR API
RAMADDA supports accessing real-time data from a <a href="https://www.sofarocean.com/">SOFAR buoy</a>
with the SOFAR Buoy Data from API entry type. 
This requires an API key that you can get from your SOFAR dashboard at
<a href=https://spotter.sofarocean.com/api>https://spotter.sofarocean.com/api</a>.
Edit one of the  .properties file in your RAMADDA home dir and add the following.
Once set you can add the SOFAR Data entry and just specify the spotter ID, e.g. SPOT-1234.

<pre>
property.sofar.api.key=YOUR KEY
</pre>

:heading Storm Tracker data
Real time storm tracker positions  from <a href=https://www.spotternetwork.org/positions>
https://www.spotternetwork.org/</a> can be added to RAMADDA.
First register on the above site and get an API key. Add the following to one of the .properties
files in your RAMADDA home directory and restart RAMADDA.
<pre>
property.stormtracker.api.key=YOUR KEY
</pre>

There is no specific entry type for Storm Tracker positions. Rather you can use download
this export - <a href=Storm_Spotter_Locations.zip>Storm_Spotter_Locations.zip</a> and import it
into your RAMADDA.
:p
This is a generic CSV File entry type but with some CSV commands in the properties that
convert the JSON from the API into RAMADDA's standard format. There is also
a Request Information Property that specifies the required HTTP request information.
