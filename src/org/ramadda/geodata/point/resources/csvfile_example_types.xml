It is easy to define new types for standard datalogger csv files

Create a file like this. The file name has to end with "types.xml"
This is how RAMADDA recognizes this is a type definition.
Copy your file into the RAMADDA homedir/plugins  directory

There can be any number of <type ...> ... </type> type definitons in this file


The below type definition supports text files of the form:
"TOA5","73307","CR1000","73307","CR1000.Std.28.02","CPU:DFAS.CR1","28010","SecondSondeData"
"TIMESTAMP","RECORD","Temp_C","SpCond_msCm","Sal_psu","Depth_m","pH","Turb_ntu","ODO_%","ODO_mgL","Battery_V","CablePwr_V","SecondSonde(11)","SecondSonde(12)"
"TS","RN","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"","","Smp","Smp","Smp","Smp","Smp","Smp","Smp","Smp","Smp","Smp","Smp","Smp"
"2019-05-02 15:46:05",81791,17.05,7.5,4.16,4.41,7.43,8.34,73.74,6.94,5.98,13.8,0,0
"2019-05-02 16:01:05",81792,17.04,7.5,4.16,4.42,7.35,10.46,68.95,6.49,5.99,13.17,0,0

<!-- Your new type should have its own name. 
Change type_point_datalogger to something else, e.g., type_point_yourtype

<![CDATA[
#This is the row that defines the field names, i.e., the second row (like above) has a comma separated list of names
fieldRow=2

#total number of header rows to skip over. In the above example there are 4 total header lines. the 2nd line has the field names
skiplines=4

#This defines the date format for the timestamp field
#If your data has a different field name for time then use that name
#the data format follows Java's https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html
#If you don't have time then no worries
timestamp.format=yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss

#You can define units for the fields with
temp_c.unit=C
depth_m.unit=M
