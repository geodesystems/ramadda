[ht::head {NLAS Harvesters}]


One way to add LiDAR data sets to RAMADDA is to set up a LiDAR Collection
harvester in RAMADDA. This is a special purpose instance of
the general purpose 
<a href="/repository/userguide/harvesters.html">File Harvester</a> facility
that RAMADDA provides.
<p>

A Harvester is configured to scan a specified server-side file system 
directory tree. A pattern can be provided to determine what files should be harvested.
The harvester will automatically detect new LiDAR files and load them into RAMADDA. 
You have the option of leaving the files in place or moving them into RAMADDA's data store.

<h2>LVIS Example</h2>

On our NLAS/LVIS machine we have data on disk:
<pre>
  mcgowan:ls lvis
  LVIS_Antarctica_2009/
  LVIS_Costa_Rica/
  LVIS_Arkansas/
  LVIS_Greenland/
  LVIS_California/
  LVIS_NH_Bartlett_Forest/

  mcgowan:ls lvis/LVIS_Arkansas/
  LVIS_US_AR_2006_20080819.lce
</pre>

That we want to map into the RAMADDA repository so that 
the LVIS_... directories
are represented with RAMADDA LiDAR Collections and the files are LiDAR Data as
shown <a href="https://nlas.unavco.org/repository/alias/lvis">here</a>.

<p>

The Harvester we have set up 
points to the top-level lvis directory.
When it scans it walks the tree down and discovers a file (e.g., 
LVIS_US_AR_2006_20080819.lce). 
The harvester creates a LiDAR Collection folder from the 
parent directory of the file (e.g.,  LVIS_Arkansas). It replaces any underscore
"_"  with a space " " and uses that as the name of the collection entry.
The file is then ingested and scanned to extract 
spatial metadata. The new LiDAR Data entry is then created
with the parent collection entry.

<p>

The NLAS plugin provides a special purpose LiDAR Collection harvester. This  harvester type
creates the right kind of folder and entry types for the harvested data.
To create a harvester you need to be a site administrator. 
From the [ht::menu Admin Harvesters] page select the New Harvester button.
Enter a name for your harvester and for Type select "LiDAR Collection" in the form:
[ht::cimg images/newharvester.png {New Harvester Form} {border=0 width=600}]

The Harvester edit form is the same as for the general purpose
<a href="/repository/userguide/harvesters.html">File Harvester</a> facility in RAMADDA.
The only difference is the Entry Types are just the LiDAR Data entry types.
<p>
Enter the server file system directory, the destination RAMADDA folder and, optionally, select
a LiDAR entry type. The harvester can be configured to automatically run on a specified schedule.
