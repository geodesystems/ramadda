[ht::head {Map and Time Series Displays}]
<%nochildlist%>

When you are viewing a LiDAR data file entry 
(e.g., <a href="https://nlas.unavco.org/repository/entry/show/NLAS+Repository/Data/LVIS+Costa+Rica/LVIS_CR_2005_WAVE_20060518_West_Slope.lgw?entryid=a26ea477-f085-4585-8cab-0cd917d6655a">LVIS Costa Rica</a>)
choose the [ht::menu {LiDAR Data} {LiDAR Map and Chart}] menu
for an interactive map and timeseries chart of the data.
If the LiDAR data file contains waveforms (as the example above does)
there will also be an image of the waveform for a given point displayed.

[ht::cimg images/chart.png {LiDAR Map and Chart} {border=0 width=800}]

Clicking on the time series image will show the approximate location 
in the map of that point in the LiDAR data
and will also create and show the waveform at that point.
<p>


<b><div class="note">Note: because the time series image is 
generated from a sub-sampling of the actual data the mapping 
and is limited in size (e.g., 800 pixels vs. 20 million points)
the positions are only approximate.</div></b>
<p>
The CSV link will give a CSV file of the displayed waveform.

The Settings section allows you to hide the map and choose other fields to 
display  in the time series:

The Waveform Background menu allows you to show the waveform fully expanded 
to the size of the time series chart. Normally the waveform is shown 
at the actual height as measured.
