[ht::head {Building RAMADDA and NLAS}]
<%nochildlist%>


It is easy to build and run RAMADDA and the NLAS plugin and tools.

This assumes you have SVN, ANT and a Java compiler installed on your machine.


<ul>

<li>  Now, check out and build the NLAS package
<pre>
svn co https://nlas.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/nlas
cd nlas/trunk
ant
</pre>


<li> This builds the nlasplugin.jar and installs it in the ramadda home directory

<li> You can restart ramadda now and it will load the plugin


# Configure the nlastools:
cd dist/nlastools
sh install.sh

# To run the tiler


</ul>
