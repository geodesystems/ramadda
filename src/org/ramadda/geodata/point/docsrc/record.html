[ht::head {RAMADDA Record Package}]

The record package provides support for reading binary and text 
oriented data files. The classes org.unavco.data.record.RecordFile 
and org.unavco.data.record.Record 
provide the core functionality of this package.

<p>
Record files are generally of the form:<pre>
    header
    record 1
    record 2
    ...
    record N
</pre>

The RecordFile class is abstract and provides functionality to read 
and write files. It uses derived instances of the 
Record class to actually read and write the data. The Record class provides support for handling endian-ness and for up-promoting
unsigned file variables (e.g., unsigned short) to the Java primitive type (e.g., int).



<subhead intoc="false" id="visitor">Record Visitor</subhead>
Access to files is based around the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">visitor pattern</a> embodied in the 
org.unavco.data.record.RecordVisitor class.
The basic algorithm is implemented in RecordFile:
<pre>
    public void visit(RecordVisitor visitor, VisitInfo visitInfo, RecordFilter filter)
</pre>

This method takes a RecordVisitor, a VisitInfo and a RecordFilter. Each record is read from 
the file and the RecordVisitor method is called:
<pre>
    public abstract boolean visitRecord(RecordFile file, VisitInfo visitInfo,   Record record);
</pre>

If this method returns false then the visit is stopped. We use the VisitInfo class to hold the state of
the visit, e.g., the RecordIO, skip factor, start and stop indices, etc.



<subhead intoc="false" id="gen">Generating record classes</subhead>



The record package provides a Tcl based script that allows one to define the structure of a record  and generate the class
that reads the record.

There are many examples  of its use under the lidar package, e.g., in org/unavco/data/lidar/lvis/generate.tcl
<pre>
generateRecordClass org.unavco.data.lidar.lvis.LceRecordV1_2  -super LvisRecord   -fields  { 
    {lfid int}
    {shotnumber int}
    {lvisTime double -declare 0}
    {tlon double}
    {tlat double}
    {zt float}
} 
</pre>
