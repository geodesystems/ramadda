<h3>Time Series Comparison</h3>

<ol>
<li>If you are plotting pressure level data, select the <b>Level</b> you wish to use
<li>For times, you can:
<ul>
    <li>Choose a starting and ending <b>month</b> over which to correlate the data.
    <li>Choose a starting and ending <b>year</b> over which to correlate the data. 
    <li>Additionally, you can select a lead/lag period for the time series. <strong>None</strong> is the 
    default and uses the same months/years as the model data.  <strong>Lead</strong> indicates that the time
    series leads the model data in time (i.e, is a predictor of the model data). <strong>Lag</strong> indicates
    that the time series lags the model data (i.e., the model predicts the state of the time series).  If you
    select <strong>Lead</strong> or <strong>Lag</strong>, then you can select the months of the time series
    lead/lag period.  If no months are selected, the model months are used with a 1 year lead or lag depending
    on which option you chose.

</ul>
<li>Select the <b>Region</b> that the data will be averaged over.  You can select from a predefined
list of regions, or select Custom.  If you choose custom, you can draw a region on the map
(use Shift+drag to draw the region), or enter the North, South, West and East coordinates of
the region.
