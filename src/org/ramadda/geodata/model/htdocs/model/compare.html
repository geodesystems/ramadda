one field to itself or another.  The instructions below explain each of the sections
of the form.
<p>

<div id="tabs">
<ul>
<li><a href="#tabs-1">Field(s)</a></li>
<li><a href="#tabs-2">Area Statistics</a></li>
<li><a href="#tabs-3">Plot Options</a></li>
<li><a href="#tabs-4">Make Plot</a></li>
</ul>

<div id="tabs-1">
<h3>Field(s)</h3>
<ol>
<li> From the <b>Collection</b>, select the <b>Model, Experiment, Ensemble Member</b> and <b>Variable</b> you wish to plot
<li> Optionally, select a second data set you wish to compare with the first.
<li> Click the <b>Select Data</b> button to bring up the options for analyzing and plotting the data you've selected.

</div>

<div id="tabs-2">
<h3>Area Statistics</h3>

<ol>
<li>If you are plotting pressure level data, select the <b>Level</b> you wish to use
<li>You can plot either the <b>Average</b>, the <b>Anomaly</b>, the <b>Standardized Anomaly</b> or
(for precipitation) the <b>Percent of Normal</b> over the region.   
Anomalies are computed relative to the <b>1981-2010</b> average for the ensemble mean.
<li>For times, depending on the configuration you can either select:
<ul>
    <li>Choose a starting and ending <b>month</b> over which to average the data.
    <li>Choose a starting and ending <b>year</b> over which to average the data. Alternatively, type in
a list of years that are separated by commas (e.g. 1983, 1986, 1997)
    <li>If you are doing a comparison, select the <b>years</b> for the second dataset.
    </p><b>OR</b></p>
    <li>Select from a list of pre-defined times.
</ul>

<h3>Plot Options</h3>

<ol>
<li>If you are doing a comparison between datasets, you can either plot the result as a difference
between the two fields, or as 2 separate plots.
<li>You can select to plot the data as an image (Map) or load it into Google Earth.
<li>For some fields, you can select the output units for the plot.
<li>You can select a mask for the data to block out either ocean or land areas.
<li>You can plot the output as color-filled contours and optionally overlay contour lines and labels.
<li>You can override the default contour intervals for the plots by specifying
