:heading Grid Aggregation
The Grid Aggregation entry type lets you aggregate any number of gridded data files.
The common use case is to aggregate the children grids on the time dimension, so for example,
if you have a number of the same grids but one time step per file you can aggregate these
files and act as if they are one grid.

For example, NOAA provides Max Stream flow grids (in GRIB2 format) available at
[https://noaa-mrms-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#CONUS/FLASH_CREST_MAXSTREAMFLOW_00.00
https://noaa-mrms-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#CONUS/FLASH_CREST_MAXSTREAMFLOW_00.00]. Each of
these GRIB files contains one time step. Go and download the files of interest. Then in RAMADDA,
Select Pick a Type... and look for Grid Aggregation:

You can leave the default settings:

Then from the new Aggregation entry choose Pick a Type... and select Gridded Data File:

Note: you can either upload each GRIB file individually or you can zip them up (as below) and upload
the zip file
-callout

Once done you will have a listing like:
