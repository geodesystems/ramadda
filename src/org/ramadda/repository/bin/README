################# Making ramaddatds.jar ################################

ramaddatds.jar holds the classes that we use from the thredds.war.
We unjar the war and then unjar the jar files contained in it. There
are some jars that we skip. To create this jar file get the latest
thredds.war (from ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/thredds) and copy
it to the ramadda/lib directory.  Then from the lib directory execute
the tcl script: 

   tclsh ../org/ramadda/repository/release/makethredds.tcl


################# Making a release ################################

You first need to build the help documentation. See below.

To make the full release do:
ant release

This creates the following files in trunk/lib. The *'ed files are
those that get released

ramadda<version>.jar
ramaddalib.jar



################# Building the help  ################################

The integrated user documentation is in:

  docs/userguide/content

This requires tclsh in your path and uses the tcl generate.tcl script. 

To build the docs do:
cd docs/userguide/content
source make.sh

This generates the documentation and places it in:
docs/userguide/processed

When the RAMADDA release is built the processed html docs are included in the result.
