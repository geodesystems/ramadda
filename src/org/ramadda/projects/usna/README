To build this USNA page template you will need to have Java (1.8) installed as well as apache ANT:

https://ant.apache.org/

From the command line change directory to this usna directory and run:
ant

This builds a usna.plugin.jar jar and copies it to your local plugins directory:
~/.ramadda/plugins

Copy this file to your RAMADDA server plugins directory and restart your server.

An alternative way to build the usna.plugin.jar without using ANT (since nothing is being compiled) 
is to zip or jar up this directory from the top level src directory. 
You zip/jar file should have the following paths:
org/ramadda/projects/usna/htdocs/usna/app.css
org/ramadda/projects/usna/htdocs/usna/edmapsbannerlogo.png
org/ramadda/projects/usna/usnatemplate.html
