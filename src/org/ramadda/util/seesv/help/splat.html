The splat command groups rows based on the key column.
It then concatenates all of the values defined in the <i>value column</i> argument
with the given delimiter and adds them as a new column to the last row in the group.

For example, if you have this data:
<data>
name,gender
Jim,male
Joe,male,
Jill,female
Sue,female
</data>

Running:
seesv:seesv -splat gender name -- combined

Would give:
<data>
name,gender,combined
Joe,male,Jim--Joe
Sue,female,Jill--Sue
</data>
