The integrate command takes some value column, usually a rate,  a date column,
a date-time unit specifier and volume column name and calculates the volume by
figuring out the elapsed time since the prior record and multiplies the rate by the time.
:p
For example, USGS stream gauge data has a discharge column in cubic feet per second (CFS).
The below command creates a volume based on the discharge.
