This creates a running sum  of one or more column values.
<p>
The sum can be reset to 0 upon a date change. For  example, if you had data across mulitple
years you can reset the sum whenever the year changes. To do this you can set a property
with the -setting command:
<seesv>
-setting  runningsum.reset &lt;date column&gt;:&lt;calendar field&gt;<br>
-runningsum column new_name
</seesv>


Where date_column is the column that holds the data and "calendar field" is one of
year,month,day,hour,minute.
So, to reset the value at every year do:

<seesv>
-setting  runningsum.reset date:year<br>
-runningsum column new_name
</seesv>
