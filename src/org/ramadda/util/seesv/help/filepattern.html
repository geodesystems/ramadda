This macro value is then applied the other SeeSV input commands.
This lets you extract some string from the filename and then use it in the commands.
The macro in the command is of the form:
<pre>
 %macroname%
</pre>

For example, if you wanted to extract the filename without the prefix and add it as a new column you could do:
seesv: -filepattern filename "/?(.*)\.csv" -add new_column "%filename%" test.csv
would give:

<data>
name,new_column
jim,test
jill,test  
</data>
