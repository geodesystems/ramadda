For example, with the below data we want to break up each row 
<data>
state,region_reg,region_census,2015,2014,2013,2012,2011,2010,2009,2008,2007,2006,2005,2004,2003
Alabama,Southeast,South,0.356,0.335,0.324,0.33,0.32,0.323,0.316,0.312,0.301,0.294,0.287,0.277,0.284
Alaska,Northwest,North,0.356,0.335,0.324,0.33,0.32,0.323,0.316,0.312,0.301,0.294,0.287,0.277,0.284
...
</data>

Calling:
seesv:-break  Value Year 3-20 -p breaker.csv

Gives:
<data>
state,region_reg,region_census,Value,Year
