This applies the pattern to each line that is read in before
it is tokenized into
columns. The "to" string can contain grouping of the form "$1", "$2".
e.g. for the file:
<pre>
prefix:column1,column2
prefix:0,1    
prefix:3,4  
</pre>

The prefix: can be stripped out
seesv: seesv -changeline "prefix:(.*)" "\$1"
