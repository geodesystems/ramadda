If you ever have a problem where the first column name looks like, e.g.:
<data>
some_name
Joe
Sue
</data>

And you are referencing some_name 
seesv:seesv -columns some_name

and you get an error like:
<pre>
ColumnSelector: Could not find column:some_name
possible columns: [some_name, 0]
</pre>

Then it could be that there is a leading bom character. In that case call:
seesv:seesv -bom -columns some_name
