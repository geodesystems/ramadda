The -shapefile command can either take a .shp shapefile or a .zip shapefile.
If it is a .zip shapefile that contains a .dbf file then then values within
the .dbf file are extracted and added as output.

The argument is a set of name/value pairs. For now these can contain an addPoints and an addShapes
values, e.g. the below will add a point which is the calculated centroid of the shape.
seesv:seesv -shapefile "addPoints true" -p test.zip


With addShapes=true the polygon will be extracted and added as a column value:
seesv:seesv -shapefile "addShapes true" -p test.zip
