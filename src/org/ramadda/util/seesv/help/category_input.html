The default input type is CSV. To print out a CSV file just do:
seesv:seesv -p test.csv

The SeeSV package can also handle  zipped or gzipped input files:
<seesv>
seesv -p test.csv.zip<br>
seesv -p test.csv.gz
</seesv>

Likewise, if you have an XLSX file the package will extract the first sheet in the input file:
seesv:seesv -p test.xlsx

If you want to extract the second sheet in the xlsx do;
seesv:seesv -sheet 2 -p test.xlsx


The SeeSV package does have some support for handling multiple input files.
It is assumed that each file is has the same set of columns.
Note: not all commands work with multiple input files.
seesv:seesv -p test1.csv test2.csv

Other file types (see below for more details) are handled as:
:p
Read each <a href="#-lines">line</a> as a single column:
<seesv>
seesv -lines -p test.txt
</seesv>


Process <a href="#-xml">xml</a> with the given path:
<seesv>
seesv -xml "path.to.rows" -p test.xml 
</seesv>

Process <a href="#-json">JSON</a>:
<seesv>
seesv -json "path.to.array" "object_paths" -p test.json
</seesv>
