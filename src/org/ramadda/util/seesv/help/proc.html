The  proc treats the given set of commands as a function or macro where they are applied to
each of the columns in sequence.

Assume you have the below data and you wanted to trim the decimal places and then make an absolute value for both columns
<data>
column1,column2
1.234,-5.890  
-7.123,8.456
</data>

The ${column} and ${column_name} macros in the commands are replaced with the column ids and names. 
You use the ${column} macro to replace the given column ID. So, running:
seesv:seesv -proc column1,colum2  -decimals "${column}" 2 -abs "${column}" -endproc

This expands out to:
seesv:seesv -decimals column1 2 -abs column1  -decimals column1 2 -abs column1
