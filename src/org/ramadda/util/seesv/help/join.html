If the file you are joining with has multiple key values within a column (e.g., space separated
IDS) you can specify a split character that is applied to the string in the column.
Each token that is split is then added as a key.
:p
To do this call the -setting command
seesv:seesv -setting join.split " " -join key_column value_column file.csv source_key_column default_value
