The -exec command allows one to integrate external programs into the processing flow.

seesv:seesv  -exec &lt;id&gt; &lt;arguments&gt;

The <i>id</i> is used to look up an environment variable (or RAMADDA runtime property) of the form:
<pre>
seesv_exec_&lt;id&gt;=/path/to/executable
</pre>

Any command line arguments given up to but not including an argument that equals "-" are
passed in to the executable. For every row the executable is called with the given arguments.
Each of the arguments can contain any number of macros of the form:
<pre>
seesv  -exec &lt;id&gt; ${url}  ${name}
</pre>
The macros get replaced with the corresponding values in the given row.
<p>
  So for example, if you have a list of urls that you want to fetch using cURL for set the environment variable:

<pre>
export seesv_exec_curl=/usr/bin/curl    
</pre>

Then assuming you have the file:
<pre>
url
url1.html
url2.html
</pre>

Call the command

<pre>
seesv  -exec curl ${url}   - -p
</pre>

This produces a new file:
<pre>
url,result
url1.html,contents of url1
url2.html,contents of url2
</pre>
