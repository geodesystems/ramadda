If you have an unstructured  text file the -text command can extract out a set of rows and columns from it.
The idea is you specify one regular expression (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">help</a>) for finding a chunk of text in the file that holds the row values
and another regular expression to extract the column values from the chunk.
<p>
Assume you have a file test.txt
<pre>
  Hello there how are you
Person:  name: Jim age: 42
and some more text  
Person:  name: Joe age: 53
Person:  name: Sally age: 93
and more
</pre>

We are going to extract the names and age with:
<pre>
seesv -text "name,age" "(?m)(?s).*?Person:(.*?$)" "name:(.*?)age: *(\d+)"
#The (?m)(?s) are directives to match multiple lines
#The (.*?$) in the first pattern is the group that is matched 
#The second pattern: name:(.*?)age: *(\d+)  has 2 groups, one  for the name and one for the age
</pre>
