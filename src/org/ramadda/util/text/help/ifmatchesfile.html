The  <span class=cmd>-ifmatchesfile</span> command takes a pattern template and a file of strings.
For each line in the file it creates a regular expression pattern using the template
by substituting the line into the pattern with the macro <i>${value}</i>.
<p>
For example, say you have a file of addresses short.csv:
<data>
address,city,state
123 oak, boulder, co
345 main, denver,co
...
</data>

And your source data has a set of full addresses full.csv:
<data>
full address,city,state
123 oak unit #5
789 pine apt 3
345 main
...
</data>

And you only want to pass through rows in full.csv
address begins with some address in the short.csv file. To do this call:
seesv:seesv -ifmatchesfile "^${value}.*" address short.csv full_address -p fill.csv

What this does is construct regexp patterns as:
<pre>
^123 oak.*
^345 main.*
...
</pre>

And then only passes through the rows in full.csv that match one of these patterns.
<p>
The command  <span class=cmd>-ifnotmatchesfile</span> does the opposite. For a row to pass through none of the patterns
can match.
