If you have a row oriented but  unstructured  text file the 
-extractpattern command can be used to extract the columns from it.
Specify a comma separated header and a regular expression 
(<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">help</a>)
with groups that define the columns.
<p>
Assume you have a file test.txt
<pre>
Person:  name: Joe age: 53
Person:  name: Sally age: 93
</pre>

Extract the data with:
<pre>
csv -extractpattern "name,age" "name:(.*)age:(.*)" -p file.txt
</pre>
