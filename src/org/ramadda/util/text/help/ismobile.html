The -ismobile command uses one of two external APIs  - 
<a href="https://numlookupapi.com/">https://numverify.com/</a>
or <a href="https://numlookupapi.com/">https://numlookupapi.com</a>.
After making an account with either of these services
set the corresponding environment variables:
<pre>
export NUMLOOKUPAPI_API_KEY=
or
export NUMVERIFY_API_KEY=
</pre>

This command is only available when running from the command line or if running within RAMADDA the user is a logged in user.
We do this as the SeeSV service within RAMADDA can be run by any user.
<p>
A cache file, ismobile.txt,  of past phone numbers will be created in the local working directory so this command can be run multiple times
without resorting to the API calls for past phone numbers.
