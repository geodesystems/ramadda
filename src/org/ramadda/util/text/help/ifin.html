The  <span class=cmd>-ifin</span> command takes a file of values and will only pass through the row if the
value in the row matches at least one of the values in the file.

For example, say you have a file  precincts.csv:
<data>
precinct
p1
p2
p3
</data>

And a file voters.csv:
<data>
name,voter precinct
jim,p1
joe,p1
sally,p7
...
</data>

If you only want voters whose  precinct is in the precints.csv you would do:
seesv:seesv -ifin precinct precincts.csv voter_precinct -p voters.csv

The  <span class=cmd>-ifnotin</span> command does the opposite only passing through rows that are not in the file, e.g.:
seesv:seesv -ifnotin precinct precincts.csv voter_precinct -p voters.csv
