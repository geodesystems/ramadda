The -ext command allows one to integrate external programs into the processing flow.

<pre>
  -ext &lt;id&gt; &lt;arguments&gt;
</pre>

The <i>id</i> is used to look up an environment variable (or RAMADDA runtime property) of the form:
<pre>
seesv_ext_&lt;id&gt;=/path/to/executable
</pre>

Any command line arguments given up to but not including an argument that begins with "-" are
passed in to the executable. The executable is called with the given arguments.
Each row that is processed is converted into a CSV string which is passed to the external command.
A CSV text string is then read from the external command.
This line is then passed on in the processing flow.
If you want to skip a line the return the string "_null_".
