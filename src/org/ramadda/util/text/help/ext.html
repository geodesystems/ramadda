The -ext command allows one to integrate external programs into the processing flow.

<pre>
  -ext &lt;id&gt; &lt;args&gt;
</pre>

The <i>id</i> is used to look up an environment variable (or RAMADDA runtime property) of the form:
<pre>
seesv_ext_&lt;id&gt;=/path/to/executable
</pre>

The executable is called with the given arguments. As the ext command
processes a row it writes a comma separated line to the stdin of the process.
A csv line should then be written by the process to stdout.
This line is then passed on in the processing flow.
If you want to skip a line the return "_null_".
