The -subd command takes the input and, based on the values of the specified columns,
subdivides the input rows into one or more output files based on the values of the given columns.
<p>
The format is
seesv:seesv  -subd col1,col2,...,colN "min1;max1;number1,min2;max2;number2,...,minN;maxN;numberN" "output_file_macro${ikey}.csv 
<p>
The min1;max1;number1 are the min/max range and the number of steps the range is divided by for each column value.
<p>
The output file is a template to use to create the destination output file.
You can use "${ikey}" for the indices or ${vkey} for the values.
<p>  
For example, you can use this to do geographic tiling of a set of input data
that contains latitude and longitude. If your input.csv file has latitude and longitude
columns the below command:
seesv:seesv  -subd latitude,longitude "-90;90;180,-180;180;360" "grid\${ikey}.csv" input.csv

says to subdivide the latitude values between -90 and 90 with 180 steps - i.e. 1 degree spacing.
The longitude is divided up between -180 and 180 with 360 steps - again, 1 degree spacing. 
The index of a latitude value is the index between -90 and 90. Likewise the index
of the longitude value is between -180 and 180. The ${ikey} for the filename
is latitudeindex_longitudeindex. So the above command produces:
<pre>
grid116_102.csv
grid116_103.csv
grid119_84.csv
grid119_85.csv
grid119_86.csv
...
</pre>


The grid${ikey}.csv is the output file name macro where ${ikey} is made up of the indices.
Using grid${vkey}.csv would give the following file names based on the values of the ranges:
<pre>
grid30_31_-92_-91.csv
grid39_40_-76_-75.csv
grid38_39_-76_-75.csv
...
</pre>
