The default input type is CSV. To print out a CSV file just do:
<pre>
seesv -p test.csv
</pre>

The SeeSV package can also handle  zipped or gzipped input files:
<pre>
seesv -p test.csv.zip
seesv -p test.csv.gz  
</pre>

Likewise, if you have an XLSX file the package will extract the first sheet in the input file:
<pre>
seesv -p test.xls
</pre>


The SeeSV package does have some support for handling multiple input files.
It is assumed that each file is has the same set of columns.
Note: not all commands work with multiple input files.

<pre>
seesv -p test1.csv test2.csv
</pre>

Other file types (see below for more details) are handled as:

<pre>
#Read each <a href="#-lines">line</a> as a single column
seesv -lines -p test.xml

#Process <a href="#-xml">xml</a> with the given path 
seesv -xml "path.to.rows" -p test.xml  

#Process <a href="#-json">JSON</a>
seesv -json "path.to.array" "object_paths" -p test.json
</pre>
