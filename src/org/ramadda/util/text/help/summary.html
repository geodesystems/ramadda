For example, with the below data, if you wanted to summarize the total units by region:
<pre>
Region,Color,Units,Sales
West,Red,1,11.00
South,Blue,8,96.00
West,Green,2,26.00
North,Blue,7,84.00
North,Green,8,104.00
South,Red,2,22.00
East,Blue,5,60.00
West,Green,2,26.00
</pre>

You would do:
<pre>
  csv -summary region units ""  sum  -p summary.csv
</pre>
Which gives:
<pre>
Region,Units sum
West,683.0
South,399.0
North,672.0
East,294.0
</pre>


If you wanted to get the sum and average of the sales:
<pre>
csv -summary region sales ""  sum,avg  -p summary.csv 
</pre>
You'd get:
<pre>
Region,Sales sum,Sales avg
West,8873.0,56.51592356687898
South,5044.0,54.236559139784944
North,8709.0,63.56934306569343
East,3730.0,57.38461538461539
</pre>

The carry over column just gets the first value for the key column. So, if you wanted to include the color column do:
<pre>
csv -summary region sales color  sum,avg  -p summary.csv 
</pre>

Which gives:
<pre>
Region,Sales sum,Sales avg,Color
West,8873.0,56.51592356687898,Red
South,5044.0,54.236559139784944,Blue
North,8709.0,63.56934306569343,Blue
East,3730.0,57.38461538461539,Blue
</pre>
