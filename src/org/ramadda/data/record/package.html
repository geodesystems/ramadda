The record package provides support for reading binary and text oriented data files.
The classes RecordFile and Record provide the core functionality of this package.

<p>
Record files are generally of the form:<pre>
    header
    record 1
    record 2
    ...
    record N
</pre>

The RecordFile class is abstract and provides functionality to read and write files. It uses derived instances of the 
Record class to actually read and write the data. The Record class provides support for handling endian-ness and for up-promoting
unsigned file variables (e.g., unsigned short) to the Java primitive type (e.g., int).


<h2>Text files</h2>

Text files are considered to be made up of a set of lines. We treat lines that start with "#" as a comment line.
Blank lines are ignored. Each line is made up of a set of tokens with some delimiter (e.g., ","). 


<h2>Record Visitor</h2>
Access to files is based around the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">visitor pattern</a> embodied in the RecordVisitor class.
The basic algorithm is implemented in RecordFile:
<pre>
    public void visit(RecordVisitor visitor, VisitInfo visitInfo, RecordFilter filter)
</pre>

This method takes a RecordVisitor, a VisitInfo and a RecordFilter. Each record is read from the file and the RecordVisitor method is called:
<pre>
    public abstract boolean visitRecord(RecordFile file, VisitInfo visitInfo,   Record record);
</pre>

If this method returns false then the visit is stopped. We use the VisitInfo class to hold the state of
the visit, e.g., the RecordIO, skip factor, start and stop indices, etc.



<h2>Generating record classes</h2>

The record package provides a Tcl based script that allows one to define the structure of a record  and generate the class
that reads the record.

There are many examples  of its use under the lidar package, e.g., in org/unavco/data/lidar/lvis/generate.tcl
<pre>
generateRecordClass org.unavco.data.lidar.lvis.LceRecordV1_2  -super LvisRecord   -fields  { 
    {lfid int}
    {shotnumber int}
    {lvisTime double -declare 0}
    {tlon double}
    {tlat double}
    {zt float}
} 
</pre>
