:heading Archive Exhibits
RAMADDA provides support for creating digital exhibits with the Archive Exhibit and
Archive Gallery entry types.
An Archive Exhibit can contain any number of Archive Gallery entries.
The order in which the Gallery entries are shown is determined by their "entry order".
To set the entry order see the 
<a href="{{root}}/userguide/wiki/sortorder.html#entryorder">User Guide</a>
:p
The Archive Gallery is a special purpose Folder that can contain both it's own children entries
as well as a list of entries from elsewhere in your RAMADDA (e.g., Archive Items, etc.).
See the <a href="{{root}}/userguide/virtualgroup.html">User Guide</a> for information
on defining these linked entries.
:p
The Gallery has a pre-defined display that, by default, shows the parent
Archive Exhibit entry as the main section. It then displays the Gallery name
as a sub-section with the Gallery description and an optional thumbnail image.
The children entries of the Gallery (e.g., Archive Items, Images, Videos, etc)
are then shown as a gallery display showing their thumbnail images (if defined).
