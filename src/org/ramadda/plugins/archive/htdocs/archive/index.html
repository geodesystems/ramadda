:heading Archive Exhibits
RAMADDA provides support for creating digital exhibits with the Archive Exhibit and
Archive Gallery entry types.
An Archive Exhibit can contain any number of Archive Gallery entries.
The order in which the Gallery entries are shown is determined by their "entry order".
To set the entry order see the 
<a href="{{root}}/userguide/wiki/sortorder.html#entryorder">User Guide</a>
:p
The Archive Gallery is a special purpose Folder that can contain both it's own children entries
as well as a list of entries from elsewhere in your RAMADDA (e.g., Archive Items, etc.).
See the  User Guide section on
<a href="{{root}}/userguide/virtualgroup.html">Virtual Entries</a> for information
on defining these external entries.
:p
The defult gallery display sorts the children entries on
entry order and then on name. There can be an issue in defining the sort order for entries that are remotely
linked. If changing their entry order is not an issue then you can just set their entry order.
However, if you can't set their entry order for the needs of the Gallery one workaround is to
directly add a special Linked Entry entry to the Gallery. The Linked Entry has a reference to another entry
(e.g. an Archive Item). It's default display is the import of the linked entry. 
The Linked Entry entry can have its entry order set to the appropriate value for display in the Gallery.
Any reference to a thumbnail image on the Linked Entry will reference the thumbnail image of the entry
that is linked.
:p
The Gallery has a pre-defined display that, by default, shows the parent
Archive Exhibit entry as the main section. It then displays the Gallery name
as a sub-section with the Gallery description and an optional thumbnail image.
The children entries of the Gallery (e.g., Archive Items, Images, Videos, etc)
are then shown as a gallery display showing their thumbnail images (if defined).
