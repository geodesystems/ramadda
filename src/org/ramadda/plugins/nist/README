This is the implementation for the Geode Systems NIST Reference Data Challenge.

To build this plugin run  ant from this directory or it gets built from the main RAMADDA build. The plugin will be in the top level/dist/plugins/misc directory

Under the data  directory is some of the source JSON data and a couple of scripts that were used to fetch and ingest the JANA data files. 

The ConvertIsotopes.java and ConvertEnergies.java are command line programs that take the NIST JSON and generate the RAMADDA entry xml format.

The Constants data was just some emacs macros on the NIST CSV listing of the constants.

The types.xml file contains the data definitions for the 3 entry types in this plugin
