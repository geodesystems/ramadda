<h2>RAMADDA Blogs</h2>

You can have any number of web logs in RAMADDA. Just go to any folder, press File-&gt;New Entry. In the big list select Weblog.

<h2>Configuring you weblog</h2>

The default UI is pretty simple. You can change the header and the side navigation through the Edit Entry page for the Web log entry.

If you want to change the header with your own image you can upload your header image as a File Attachment from the Edit-&gt;Add Properties menu (under "Thumbnails, Page Style, etc."). Then, edit the Web log entry, Add the following wiki text in the header:
<pre>
{{image src="::&lt;filename&gt;.png" align="center"}}
</pre> 

The navigation text is also treated as Wiki text.
