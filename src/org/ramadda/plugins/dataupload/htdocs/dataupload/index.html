<h2>Data Upload</h2>
RAMADDA provides a data upload API that enables record oriented data to
be uploaded and appended to some file based on a sensor ID
This service is centered around one or more groups, i.e., a group of
data files. For each group you need to define the following properties
in the repository.properties file in your RAMADDA home directory:


<pre>
upload.&lt;GROUP&gt;.directory=/path/to/store/the/files
upload.&lt;GROUP&gt;.file=file name template
upload.&lt;GROUP&gt;.header=header for when a file is created
upload.&lt;GROUP&gt;.apikey=apikey

e.g. for a group "group1":
upload.group1.directory=/data/group1
upload.group1.file=somedata_{sensor}.csv
upload.group1.header=#This is the header for the data\nd1,d2,d3
upload.group1.apikey=mykey

</pre>

<ul>
<li> The .header is used when a file is first created. Use "\n" as a new line. RAMADDA
will also write out a new line at the end of the header. 
<li> The .file property is a template that gives the name of the file to create. Use "{sensor}"
  for the sensor id and "{group}" for the group id
<li> The .apikey is used to verify the API call to upload data
</ul>

The above properties define a group "group1". To upload a record for the sensor "sensor1"
simply call the API with:
<pre>
https://server/data/upload?apikey=&lt;your key&gt;&group=group1&sensor=sensor1&data=7,8,9
</pre>

This results in a new file called somedata_sensor1.csv
under the directory /data/group1. The file will initially hold:
<pre>
#This is the header for the data
d1,d2,d3
7,8,9
</pre>

If you wanted to upload multiple records then do:
<pre>
https://server/data/upload?apikey=&lt;your key&gt;&group=group1&sensor=sensor1&data=7,8,9\n10,11,12
</pre>

Data from another sensor would be uploaded as:

<pre>
https://server/data/upload?apikey=&lt;your key&gt;&group=group1&sensor=sensor2&data=7,8,9\n10,11,12
</pre>

Note: the return of the above API calls will be JSON of the form:
<pre>
{"code":"ok","message":"data uploaded"}
</pre>

If there is an error it will return, e.g.:
<pre>
  {"code":"error","message":"No upload group found"}
</pre>
