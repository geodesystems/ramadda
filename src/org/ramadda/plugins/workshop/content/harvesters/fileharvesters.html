documentation</a> describing harvesters. We'll just set a couple of things:
<ul>
<li> A harvester needs to know what file path to harvest. Specify the workshop data directory
<li> You then need to specify a Base folder as the destination of the new entries. Select the
Data folder
<li> Under the Metadata section select "Add full metadata"
<li> Save your changes
</ul>

<li> Run your harvester
<ul>
<li> Go back to the main <a href="http://localhost:8080/repository/harvester/list">Harvester</a> page
<li> Press Start for your new harvester
<li> This may take a little while
</ul>

<li> Now, go to your Data folder to see the results
