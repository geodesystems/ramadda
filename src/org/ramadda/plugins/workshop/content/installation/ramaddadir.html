[ht::head {RAMADDA Home Directory}]

Let's look at where RAMADDA stores data and content on disk.

<ul>
<li> Bring up a terminal window.
<li> The repository.properties file we copied into the Tomcat directory
specifies the RAMADDA home:
<pre>
/usr/share/tomcat6/conf
</pre>
<li> Do:
<pre>
cd /usr/share/tomcat6/conf
ls
</pre>

And you should see:
<pre>
derby      - The built in Java Derby database
htdocs     - A place where RAMADDA looks for miscellaneous web content
idv        - Used by the IDV visualization plugin. You can 
             put IDV plugins here (e.g., colortables, maps, etc)
logs       - Stores log files
plugins    - RAMADDA plugins
resources  - ???
storage    - Where RAMADDA stores files 
tmp        -  A temporary directory 
</pre>


<li> If you forgot to install the plugins when you configured RAMADDA then:
<ul>
<li> Fetch the allplugins.jar from the 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ramadda/">RAMADDA SourceForge site</a>
<li> Copy the allplugins.jar file to the plugins directory
<li> You will need to restart RAMADDA to have it load the new plugins.
</ul>


</ul>
