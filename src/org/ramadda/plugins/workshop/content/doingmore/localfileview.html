[ht::head {Local File View}]


The Local File View entry type allows you to create a dynamic view
of portions of your file system.

<ol>
<li> Make sure you are logged in as an Administrator account
<li> Create a Local File View entry
<ul>
<li> Navigate to the Data folder on your local RAMADDA: 
<a href="http://localhost:8080/repository/entry/show/Data">http://localhost:8080/repository/entry/show/Data</a>
<li> Go to [ht::menu File {New Entry}]
<li> Under the General section select Local File View
<li> Specify some name - Local Data Files
<li> Under the "Look for files here" section enter the data directory on your server, e.g.:<pre>
    /data
</pre> or:<pre>
    &lt;user home&gt;/data
</pre>

<li> Press Save and note the results.
</ul>
<li> The problem is we are trying to access files on the server in an area that RAMADDA
has not been authorized to access.
<ul>
<li> Go to the Admin page and under the Access section enter the data directory path and press Change Settings:
[ht::cimg images/fileaccess.png {} "width=600"]
<li> Now, go view the Local File View entry
</ul>

</ol>
