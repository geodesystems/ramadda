[ht::head {Basic Repository Administration}]



RAMADDA provides a web-based interface for managing the repository.

These are available via the 
<a href="http://localhost/repository/admin/settings">Admin</a>
link.

Some of the more important items are:

<ul>
<li> Configure your Tomca to support SSL. <a href="http://localhost:8080/repository/help/installing.html">More information here</a>

<li> Site and Contact Information
<ul>
<li> Hostname and HTTP port: These are what your external users see. They are used when RAMADDA needs to make an absolute URL back to itself.
<li> Administrator Email and Mail Server: To enable RAMADDA to send email (e.g., password reset messages) enter your mail server.
<li> Server Registry: This is used to support distributed search. Note: More work needs to be done.
</ul>

<li> Access
<ul>
<li> Site Access: Controls who can access your server.
<li> Sizes... Control disk usage for anonymous uploads and the cache
<li> File Access: Specify where else (other than the RAMADDA home directory) RAMADDA can access files. 
<li> Enable Lucene Indexing and Search: RAMADDA has some initial support for using Lucene (a indexing and search engine) to support full text search. This is experimental.
</ul>

<li> Display
<ul>
<li> Controls the display and what is shown. Note: some of these items (e.g, logo image) only show up in certain display templates and others (e.g., enable ratings, google maps key, Facebook comments) are experimental and might not work.
</ul>
<li> System: Displays system status
<li> Logs: Shows recent access and error log
<li> Maintenance: Clean up the database and dump the databse. 
Note -  this functionality needs work.
</ul>
