Lets  create a couple of user accounts.

<ol>
<li> Press New User
<li> In the form specify the user information. For this exercise
specify "user1" as the ID. Under Roles specify "test". Specify a
easily remembered password for this exercise.

will own. Select the People folder.
<li> If you had email enabled for your RAMADDA you can also choose to send an
email with the login information.

</ol>
