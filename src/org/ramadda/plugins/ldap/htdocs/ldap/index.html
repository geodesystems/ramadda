<h2>LDAP User Authentication</h2>

You can configure RAMADDA to use an LDAP server for user authentication.

<ul>
<li>
The LDAP plugin comes in the Core plugins. If you don't have the Core plugins installed then install the 
ldapplugin.jar from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ramadda/files/ramadda<%ramadda.version%/plugins">SourceForge</a> site 
into the RAMADDA home/plugins directory.

<li> 
Copy the example <a href="ldap.properties">ldap.properties</a> file into the RAMADDA home directory.

<li> Edit the settings in the property file to define the LDAP server and user configurations.

</ul>
