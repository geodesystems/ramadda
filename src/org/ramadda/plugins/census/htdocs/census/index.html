<h2>Census Data</h2>
This uses the <a href=https://www.census.gov/data/developers.html>American Community Survey API</a>. 
An API key may be required to access this data. You can obtain a key from
<a href=https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html>api.census.gov</a>.
Once you have a key add the following to your repository.properties file:
<pre>
census.api.key=your  key
</pre>



<h3>Indicators</h3>
There are 45000 indicators that can be selected. A <a href="${root}/census/variables">top-level search form</a> is provided. 
In the edit form for a Census entry you can select which indicators to use.  The indicators are categorized and you can restrict your search for a particular category of indicators, e.g. to search for indicators in the group "Median Income by Place of Birth in the United States" enter:<br>
<i>category:b05006 your search term</i>.

You can specify that the value shown for a particular indicator is a percentage of another indicator. Say for example you have population data by gender (B01001_002E, B01001_026E). You can specify that the indicators are a percentage of another column by appending ":%&lt;column&gt;" to the indicator id. For the below indicators we append ":%1" (zero based numbering) to use the second column (population).

<pre>
NAME           //geography
B01001_001E    //population
B01001_002E:%1 //male population
B01001_026E:%1 //female population
</pre>

<h3>Headers</h3>
The Headers field allows you to specify an alternative set of indicator names, one per line, to use in place of the names from the Census Bureau.


<h3>Geographies</h3>



The data is selected based on a geography specification - e.g., state, county, tract, etc. More information here -
