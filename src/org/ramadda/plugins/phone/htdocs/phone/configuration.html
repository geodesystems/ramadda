The phone services in RAMADDA uses <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>.


<h2>Configuring Twilio</h2>

You need to create an account at <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>. 
Once you have an account set up you should also have a new phone number. Twilio requires 2 URLs on your RAMADDA server
to be associated with the phone number:
<pre>
http://&lt;your ramadda&gt;/phone/twilio/sms
http://&lt;your ramadda&gt;/phone/twilio/voice
e.g.:
http://ramadda.org/repository/phone/twilio/sms
http://ramadda.org/repository/phone/twilio/voice
</pre>



You then need to define the following properties on your RAMADDA server
(e.g., in a phone.properties file in your RAMADDA home directory) 

<pre>
#Twilio Application SID
twilio.appid=

#Twili authorization token (for reading the transcription)
twilio.authtoken=

#If you have a paid twilio account set this to true to transcribe voice
#twilio.transcribe=true or false
</pre>

This is the application SID and the authorization token you can get from your Twilio account dashboard.


<h2>Configuring Phone Harvesters</h2>
The real work in handling a call is done with one or more Phone Harvesters. These are RAMADDA harvesters that define
the RAMADDA folder to look at and access information. Go to Admin-Harvesters and create a new Phone Harvester:

<p>
<img src="harvester.png"  class="image-outer">
<p>


<p>
The   <i>From Phone</i> and  <i>To Phone</i> are optional. 
If defined, this harvester will only access calls from/to these numbers.
<p>
There are 3 access levels specified by (potentially) different passwords - View, Add and Edit.
If you enter "any"  for these passwords then no password is required for that action.

<p>
To enable receiving voice messages specify a <i>Voice Message</i> response.
