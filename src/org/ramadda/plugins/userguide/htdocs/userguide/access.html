You can define access control settings under the &quot;Edit -&gt; Access&quot; menu for an entry.


<a name="image1"></a><div class="userguide-image-centered"><a href="images/access.png"><img  src="images/access.png" border=0 width=600 alt="Entry Access Control" ></a><br><span class="caption">Image 1: Entry Access Control</span></div>

<div class="important">
Note: after setting access (e.g., creating a private space) it is best to log out (or user another browser)
and check if the access is set to what you think it is.
</div>




The access control mechanism in RAMADDA is centered around a set of actions (e.g., viewing, new, edit)
and a set of user roles that have permissions to do those actions.
On the left of this form lists each of the actions. For each action there
is a field where you can enter any number of user roles (one per line).

<div class="important">
Note: Access control settings have no effect on RAMADDA site administrators. They can do anything.
</div>

On the right shows a summary table for the particular entry we are viewing. This shows the access control
settings for all of the ancestor folders of the entry and allows the user to see just what access settings
are applicable to the entry.
<p>
To see if a given user has the ability to do a particular action for a particular entry RAMADDA looks
at the permissions for the entry. 
<ul>
<li> If there are no permissions defined then the parent entry is recursively checked.
<li> If the user matches one of the roles then permission is granted.
<li> If there is a specific denial of permission (e.g, "none") then permission is not granted.
<li> If nothing matches then, by default, permission is not granted. However, the permissions 
of the parent are checked if there is a special role "inherit" defined. Also, if the RAMADDA
repository has the property <i>ramadda.auth.stopatfirstrole=false</i> set to false then the parent 
is always checked.
<li> This process continues to the top most entry which has a set of default permissions.
</ul> 
<p>
In the example shown above any user in the role "group1" can view anything under the Parent Folder.
No other user can view the Parent Folder because of the "none" specified.
Along with the view access, the user "joe" can also edit the Parent Folder and any entry under
the Parent Folder.
<p>

Here are other examples:
<ul>
<li> To make a whole tree of entrys inaccessable - under the <i>view</i> action enter:
<div class="access-example">
none
</div>
<li> If you wanted to give a certain user permission (e.g., joe) to view the entry but not allow
any one else to view then enter under the <i>view</i> action:
<div class="access-example">
user:joe<br>
none
</div>

RAMADDA would first check if the given user was "joe". If it is "joe" then permission is granted. If
its not "joe" then RAMADDA looks at the next role - "none". This blocks any other access.

<div class="important">
Note: If you did not specify "none" here then permission  would still be denied unless
the <i>ramadda.auth.stopatfirstrole=false</i> property has been set for the entire repository.
</div>

<li> To allow for a group of users in the role "group1" to be able to edit and create new entries under a whole 
tree then enter:
<div class="access-example">
group1
</div>
for both the <i>edit</i> and the <i>new</i> actions.

<li> A common case is to allow one role to have new and edit capabilities under a whole tree (like the group1 
example above) but to grant new and edit capabilities to some other user to a sub tree. For this you would 
grant the access to the parent entry like above, e.g.:
<ul>
  <li> parent entry - access = <div class="access-example">group1</div>
  <ul>
    <li> ...
       <ul>
          <li> descendent entry - access = <div class="access-example">otheruser<br>inherit</div>
       </ul>
   </ul>
</ul>

Because the descendent entry has "inherit" defined then the parent entry is checked.

</ul>





<a name="roles"></a>
:h2: <a href="#roles">Roles</a>

Each access type can contain any number of roles (one per line). 
<ul>
<li> Special roles 
<ul>
<li> <i>any</i> - this is a special role and says that anyone can do the action.
<li> <i>none</i> - nobody (except admins) can do the action.
<li> <i>user</i> - any logged in user
<li> <i>anonymous</i> - the  user is not logged in
<li> <i>guest</i> - the  user is a guest user
</ul>
<li> Assigned user roles - All users can have one or more roles. This is set by the site administrator 
when editing the user. They are just string names. For example, you might have the roles "group1" and
"group2". If you wanted to grant access to "group1" you would just enter:
<div class="access-example">group1</div>

If you wanted to grant access to users in either group1 or group2 you would enter:
<div class="access-example">group1<br>group2</div>


<li> Self identity role - If you enter a role in the form as <i>user:someuserid</i> this grants 
access to that specific user. So, if you wanted to give "joe" access to something enter:
<div class="access-example">user:joe</div>

<li> <i>ip:ip address</i>  - This format grants access to incoming requests with the given ip address or ip address suffix.
For example, the following would grant access to any request coming from any IP address that starts with 128.117

<div class="access-example">ip:128.117</div>

<li> <i>!some role</i> - Prefixing a role with &quot;!&quot; is a way to deny specific access to a user, role, or ip address.
For example, the following would deny access to any request coming from any IP address that starts with 128.117:
<div class="access-example">!ip:128.117</div>

Say you want to grant access to user "joe" but deny access to user "jim". You would do:
<div class="access-example">user:joe<br>!user:jim</div>

</ul>



<a name="accesstypes"></a>
:h2: <a href="#accesstypes">Access Types</a>

The different access types are:
<ul>
<a name="view"></a>
<li> View - Can a user view the entry. If a user does not have view access they will simply not
see the entry and cannot access any aspect of the entry.

<a name="viewchildren"></a>
<li> View Children - This is used for a folder where a user without permission can see that the folder exists (e.g., "Unidata Only")
but cannot see any of the details of the folder or any of the children entry of the folder.

<a name="file"></a>
<li> File - This allows users to see the information about an entry but they cannot access the file. i.e., they cannot download the
file or access any of the content of the file (e.g., through OpenDAP).

<a name="edit"></a>
<li> Edit - Can a user edit the entry.

<a name="new"></a>
<li> New - Can a user create a new sub-folder or sub-entry. Note: when users have this permission they
also need Edit permission.

<a name="upload"></a>
<li> Upload - This provides anonymous upload capability. For example, we use this
to provide an <a href="http://motherlode.ucar.edu/repository/entry/show/Top/IDV+Community+Resources/Contributions?entryid=bfc82cf9-8548-4393-af10-20ec2274ceb9">area </a> for IDV users to upload shared content.
When a file is uploaded it is marked so that only administrators or owners of the Folder can access it. The owner
of the folder will receive an email (if email is configured) notifying them of the uploaded file.
In the Edit page for the uploaded Entry the owner can "bless" the entry to make it available to others.
<p>
If you want more people than the owner to receive notification simply add  a "Contact" property to the folder
that contains the other recipient's email.

<a name="delete"></a>
<li> Delete - Can  a user delete an entry.

<a name="comment"></a>
<li> Comment - Can a user comment on an entry.

</ul>
