You can define access control settings under the &quot;Edit -&gt; Access&quot; menu for an entry.
<p>
  The access control mechanism in RAMADDA is centered around a set of actions that can be
  applied to entries - <br>
  <i>view</i>, <i>new</i>, <i>edit</i>, etc.
<br>
For each action a set of user roles can be specified 
that grant or remove  permissions to do those actions.
The form is composed of this list of actions and, for each action,
there is a field where you can enter any number of user roles (one per line).

+callout-info
Note: Access control settings have no effect on RAMADDA site administrators. They can do anything.

Note: after setting access (e.g., creating a private space) it is best to log out (or user another browser)
and check if the access is set to what you think it is.

The roles for a user are defined by the RAMADDA administrator through the Admin-Users page.
Other "special" roles include:
<ul>
  <li> "none" - this denies access to any user
  <li> "user"  - any logged in user
  <li> "any"  - any user, either logged in or anonymous
  <li> "anonymous"  - non logged in user
  <li> "ip:prefix"  - The user is coming from an IP address that begins with prefix
</ul>

Furthermore, any role can be negated with "!"

<p>
In the example shown above any user in the role "group1" can view anything under the
sub test entry.
No other user can view the "sub test" because of the "none" specified.
Along with the view access, the user "joe" can also edit the entry and any entry under
the entry.
<p>

On the right shows a summary table for the particular entry being viewed.
This shows the access control
settings for all of the ancestor entries of the current entry and allows the 
user to see just what access settings are applicable to the entry.

+callout-info
To see if a given user has the ability to do a particular action for a particular entry RAMADDA looks
at the permissions for the entry and its ancestors and either looks for the
first permission  grant or the first permission denial.
If nothing matches then permission is not granted. 
-callout


Here are other examples:
<ul>
<li> To make a whole tree of entrys inaccessable - under the <i>view</i> action enter:
<pre>
none
</pre>

This will only allow admins and entry owners to view anything under that tree.

<li> To make an entry (or tree of entries) inaccessable to non logged in users - under the <i>view</i> action enter:
<pre>
user
none
</pre>

<li> To make an entry (or tree of entries) inaccessable to users outside of an ip address  - under the <i>view</i> action enter:
<pre>
ip:some_ip_prefix
none
</pre>


<li> To allow anyone to view the entries in a tree but don't allow anyone to
  access the files then under the <i>file</i> action enter:
<pre>
none
</pre>

<li> To allow anyone to view the entries in a tree but only allow file access to
 users who are coming from the IP address 123.456 then 
under the <i>file</i> action do:
<pre>
ip:123.456
none
</pre>


<li> If you wanted to give a certain user permission (e.g., joe) to view the entry but not allow
any one else to view the entry then enter under the <i>view</i> action:
<pre>
user:joe
none
</pre>

RAMADDA would first check if the given user was "joe". If it is "joe" then permission is granted. If
its not "joe" then RAMADDA looks at the next role - "none". This blocks any other access.


<li> To allow for a group of users in the role "group1" to be able to edit and create new entries under a whole 
tree then enter:
<pre>
group1
</pre>

for both the <i>edit</i> and the <i>new</i> actions.

<li> A common case is to allow one role to have new and edit capabilities under a whole tree (like the group1 
example above) but to grant new and edit capabilities to some other user to a sub tree. For this you would 
grant the access to the parent entry like above, e.g.:
<ul>
  <li> parent entry - access = <div class="access-example">group1</div>
  <ul>
    <li> ...
       <ul>
          <li> descendent entry - access = <div class="access-example">otheruser</div>
       </ul>
   </ul>
</ul>
</ul>




<a name="roles"></a><p><div class="ramadda-help-heading">3.4.0 <a href="#roles">Roles</a></div> 

Each access type can contain any number of roles (one per line). 
<ul>
<li> Special roles 
<ul>
<li> <i>any</i> - this is a special role and says that anyone can do the action.
<li> <i>none</i> - nobody (except admins) can do the action.
<li> <i>user</i> - any logged in user
<li> <i>anonymous</i> - the  user is not logged in
<li> <i>guest</i> - the  user is a guest user
</ul>
<li> Assigned user roles - All users can have one or more roles. This is set by the site administrator 
when editing the user. They are just string names. For example, you might have the roles "group1" and
"group2". If you wanted to grant access to "group1" you would just enter:
<pre>
group1
</pre>

If you wanted to grant access to users in either group1 or group2 you would enter:
<pre>
group1
group2
</pre>


<li> Self identity role - If you enter a role in the form as <i>user:someuserid</i> this grants 
access to that specific user. So, if you wanted to give "joe" access to something enter:
<pre>
user:joe
</pre>

<li> <i>ip:ip address</i>  - This format grants access to incoming requests with the given ip address or ip address suffix.
For example, the following would grant access to any request coming from any IP address that starts with 128.117

<pre>
ip:128.117
</pre>

<li> <i>!some role</i> - Prefixing a role with &quot;!&quot; is a way to deny specific access to a user, role, or ip address.
For example, the following would deny access to any request coming from any IP address that starts with 128.117:
<pre>
!ip:128.117
</pre>

Say you want to grant access to user "joe" but deny access to user "jim". You would do:
<pre>
user:joe
!user:jim
</pre>

</ul>



<a name="accesstypes"></a><p><div class="ramadda-help-heading">3.4.1 <a href="#accesstypes">Access Types</a></div> 

The different access types are:
<ul>
<a name="view"></a>
<li> View - Can a user view the entry. If a user does not have view access they will simply not
see the entry and cannot access any aspect of the entry.

<a name="viewchildren"></a>
<li> View Children - This is used for a folder where a user without permission can see that the folder exists (e.g., "Unidata Only")
but cannot see any of the details of the folder or any of the children entry of the folder.

<a name="file"></a>
<li> File - This allows users to see the information about an entry but they cannot access the file. i.e., they cannot download the
file or access any of the content of the file (e.g., through OpenDAP).

<a name="edit"></a>
<li> Edit - Can a user edit the entry.

<a name="new"></a>
<li> New - Can a user create a new sub-folder or sub-entry. Note: when users have this permission they
also need Edit permission.

<a name="upload"></a>
<li> Upload - This provides anonymous upload capability. For example, we use this
to provide an <a href="http://motherlode.ucar.edu/repository/entry/show/Top/IDV+Community+Resources/Contributions?entryid=bfc82cf9-8548-4393-af10-20ec2274ceb9">area </a> for IDV users to upload shared content.
When a file is uploaded it is marked so that only administrators or owners of the Folder can access it. The owner
of the folder will receive an email (if email is configured) notifying them of the uploaded file.
In the Edit page for the uploaded Entry the owner can "bless" the entry to make it available to others.
<p>
If you want more people than the owner to receive notification simply add  a "Contact" property to the folder
that contains the other recipient's email.

<a name="delete"></a>
<li> Delete - Can  a user delete an entry.

</ul>


<a name="datapolicy"></a><p><div class="ramadda-help-heading">3.4.2 <a href="#datapolicy">Data Policies</a></div> 
RAMADDA has support for a data policy mechanism that allows for
the specification of a data license and access settings in a centralized
location. This allows for the use of a single data policy across multiple
entries within a single RAMADDA repository as well as sharing data policies
across a group of confederated RAMADDA repositories.
See the documentation at <a href=https://ramadda.org/repository/a/datapolicy>
https://ramadda.org/repository/a/datapolicy
</a>
for more details.



A RAMADDA repository is configured to read in data policies
from a set of URLs specified in a repository.properties file
in your local RAMADDA home directory.
<pre>
#Comma separated list of URLS to fetch the data policies from
#Use "this" to refer to the current RAMADDA
ramadda.datapolicy.urls=this,https://ramadda.org/datapolicy/v1/list

#Number of minutes between fetches of data policies from the URLs
ramadda.datapolicy.sleepminutes=30

#Set this property to turn on debugging
ramadda.datapolicy.debug=true
</pre>

The URLs specified are read at a given frequency (with the property above).
Each URL returns a document that has one or more data policies. 
A data policy consists of name, ID, data license and a number of permissions.
