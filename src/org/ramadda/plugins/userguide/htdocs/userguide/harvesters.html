If you are a site administrator you can create entry harvesters that will
scan either the server file system or will fetch web-based resources and 
automatically ingest them into the repository.
:p

<a name="harvesting"></a>
:heading Harvesting files

The File Harvester facility allows scans the local file system on the server 
and add entries into the database for those files.
For example, say you have a large directory of data (and/or other) files (e.g., <i>/project/data</i>)
that you want RAMADDA to provide access to.
The File Harvester can walk the directory tree and add entries into the repository for the files it finds.

:p
The first thing you need to do is to specify in the <a href='admin.html#filesystemaccess'>Site Administration</a> area
that it is OK to serve up files from that directory tree. Go to the <span class="ramadda-docs-menu">Admin-&gt;Settings-&gt;Access</span> page in RAMADDA 
and enter the directory path, e.g., <i>/project/data</i>:

<div style='text-align:center;' class='ramadda-docs-image'><a name="image1"></a><div><a href="images/filesystemaccess.png?version=114"><img  src="images/filesystemaccess.png?version=114"  onload='HtmlUtils.initScreenshot(this);this.onload=null;' style='display:none;'  alt="File System Access" ></a><br><span class="caption">Image 1: File System Access</span></div></div>

Next, create a File Harvester by going to the Harvesters tab of the Admin pages and press the &quot;New Harvester&quot; button. 
Specify a name (e.g., &quot;Test&quot;), leave the type as Local Files and hit create:

<div style='text-align:center;' class='ramadda-docs-image'><a name="image2"></a><div><a href="images/harvester1.png?version=114"><img  src="images/harvester1.png?version=114"  onload='HtmlUtils.initScreenshot(this);this.onload=null;' style='display:none;'  alt="Create a new File Harvester" ></a><br><span class="caption">Image 2: Create a new File Harvester</span></div></div>

This will take you to the Harvester Edit form. The minimal configuration you need to do here is to enter the file 
system directory to scan and the RAMADDA folder to add the harvested entries to. In this example
we are harvesting the directory tree <i>/project/data</i> and we are adding the entries into
the RAMADDA folder <i>RAMADDA/Case Studies/Test</i>:

<div style='text-align:center;' class='ramadda-docs-image'><a name="image3"></a><div><a href="images/harvester2.png?version=114"><img  src="images/harvester2.png?version=114"  onload='HtmlUtils.initScreenshot(this);this.onload=null;' style='display:none;'  alt="Harvester Edit Form" ></a><br><span class="caption">Image 3: Harvester Edit Form</span></div></div>


When you have entered this information press &quot;Change&quot; which will apply the changes and then take you back
to the Harvester Edit Form. You can start this Harvester with the &quot;Start&quot; link in the upper right. Or you can
go to the main Harvesters page (the top Harvesters tab) and this will list your Harvester. From there you can start the
Harvester and monitor and/or stop its progress. When it is finished the Stop link will change to Start.

<p>

With the above settings the directory tree of your file system will be used to create the 
folder hierarchy in RAMADDA. Every file the Harvester finds will result in a file entry. You can run
a Harvester any number of times and it will only add the new files that it has not seen before.

<p>


<a name="run"></a><p><div class="ramadda-help-heading">7.4.0 <a href="#run">Run Settings</a></div> 
The form has  settings for running the harvester. When you are first creating a harvester sometimes it
may takes some time to figure out just what you are harvesting and the name and folder settings for the repository
entry. So, its good to turn on test mode. This will result in entries not being added to the repository when you run
the harvester. Rather, when in test mode, up to &quot;Count&quot; number of files will be found and the results will be
listed in the &quot;Information&quot; section of the harvester page.
<p>
The &quot;Active on startup&quot; flag, when set, results in the harvester being started when the repository
starts up. The &quot;Run continually&quot; flag has the harvester continually run. It uses the &quot;Every&quot; setting
to determine the pauses between runs. You can choose Absolute time to pause every N minutes. Or, you can choose
&quot;Minutes&quot; or &quot;Hourly&quot; to have it run relative to the hour or the day, e.g. &quot;3 hourly&quot;
will run at 0Z, 3Z, 6Z, 9Z, etc. <p>
For example, if you know you are getting data files  in real-time that are coming in every 30 minutes you could set your harvester
to run in &quot;Absolute&quot; mode every 15 minutes. If you had a Web harvester that is fetching images
you might want to use an &quot;Hourly&quot; setting to get the image at some fixed interval (e.g., 0Z, 6Z, 12Z, 18Z, etc).


<a name="files"></a><p><div class="ramadda-help-heading">7.4.1 <a href="#files">Files Settings</a></div> 
Under &quot;Look for files&quot; you specify a directory on the server file system to scan and a regular expression to
match on the file name.
The repository will recursively scan the directory tree and any files it finds that matches the pattern it will
add to the repository. 
<p>
The regular expressions used are somewhat extended in that you can specify subsets of the regular expression
and use the result text for metadata and other information when creating the entry in the repository.
For example, a very common case is to have a date/time embedded in the filename. So, you could have in your regular 
expression something of the form:
<pre>
.*data(fromdate:\d\d\d\d\d\d\d\d_\d\d\d\d)\.nc
</pre>

This would  match any files of the form:<pre>
data_yyyymmdd_hhmm.nc
</pre>
The &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot; define the sub-expression (just like normal regular expression). But the
&quot;fromdate:&quot; is the special extension that tells the harvester that that sub-expression
is used to create the repository entry fromdate field.
<p>
The date format that is used is defined in the Date Format field and follows the
Java <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">date format</a> conventions.
<p>
If you are creating entries of a certain type that has a number of attributes you can extract the attribute values
using this extended regular expression technique. For example, if you had an entry with two attributes attr1 and attr2
and your files were of the format:
<pre>
&ltattr1&gt;_&ltattr2&gt;.csv
</pre>

Your regular expression would be:
<pre>
(attr1:[^/]+.)_(attr2:[^/]*).csv
</pre>

This says that attr1 is any number of characters except the slash ("/"). The slash exclusion is
used to exclude the file path as the full file path is used when matching patterns.
The value for attr2 follows the "_" and is any number of characters except a slash.



<a name="entry"></a><p><div class="ramadda-help-heading">7.4.2 <a href="#entry">Entry Creation</a></div> 


When creating an entry we need to know the folder to put it under, its name and description.
You specify templates for these that can contain a set of macros (see below).
Note: this is where the Test mode described above is useful. Sometimes it takes a while to figure
just what you want in terms of folder structure and entry names.

<p>

To define the folder you need to select an existing base folder and then optionally specify 
a folder template. The folder template is used to automatically create a new folder if needed.
So for example, if your base folder was: <i>Top/Data</i> and your Folder Template was: <i>Ingested/Satellite</i>
then the result folder would be:<pre>
<i>Top/Data/Ingested/Satellite</i>
</pre>

The Harvester would create the <i>Ingested</i> and the <i>Satellite</i> folders as needed.

<p>

The name, description and folder templates all can contain the following macros.
Note: The different date fields (e.g., create_, from_ and to) refer to
the create date/time, the from data time (which defaults to the create date
unless specified in the pattern) and the to data time.

<p>

<table>
<tr><td><i>${filename}</i></td><td>The file name (not the full path)</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>${fileextension}</i></td><td>The file extension</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>${dirgroup}</i></td><td>See below</td></tr>
<tr><td>            <i>${create_date}</i>,<i>${from_date}</i>, <i>${to_date}</i></td><td>The full formatted date string</td></tr>
<tr><td>            <i>${create_day}</i>, <i>${from_day}</i>, <i>${to_day}</i></td><td>The numeric day of the month</td></tr>
<tr><td>            <i>${create_week}</i>,   <i>${from_week}</i>,  <i>${to_week}</i></td><td>The numeric week of the month</td></tr>
<tr><td>            <i>${create_weekofyear}</i>, <i>${from_weekofyear}</i>,  <i>${to_weekofyear}</i></td><td>The numeric week of the year</td></tr>
<tr><td>            <i>${create_month}</i>,<i>${from_month}</i>, <i>${to_month}</i></td><td>Numeric month of the year</td></tr>
<tr><td>            <i>${create_monthname}</i>,<i>${from_monthname}</i>,  <i>${to_monthname}</i></td><td>Month name</td></tr>
<tr><td>            <i>${create_year}</i>, <i>${from_year}</i>, <i>${to_year}</i></td><td>Numeric year</td></tr>
</table>

<p>


The dirgroup macro  is the parent directories of the
data file up to but not including the main directory path we are searching under.
For example, if you are looking under a directory called "/data/idd" and that directory held sub-dirs:<pre>
/data/idd/dir1/data1.nc
/data/idd/dir1/dir2/data2.nc
</pre>

Then when ingesting the data1.nc file its dirgroup value would be:
<pre>
dir1
</pre>

When ingesting the data2.nc file its dirgroup value would be:
<pre>
dir1/dir2
</pre>

Another  common  way of defining the folder is to use the date macros. For example a folder template of the form:<pre>
${from_year}/${from_monthname}/Week ${from_week}
</pre>

Would result in folders like:
<pre>
2009/January/Week 1
2009/January/Week 2
...
2009/March/Week 1
2009/March/Week 2
</pre>



You can also name the entrys using the macros. So, using the above date based folder template you could then have a Name template that incorporates the formatted date:<pre>
Gridded data - ${from_date}
</pre>






<p>
The <i>Move file to storage</i> checkbox allows you to determine whether the file is to be moved from its initial location
to the RAMADDA storage area.
<br>
<b>Note: If the file is not moved to the storage area than one of the data directories the file lies under needs to be added
to the list of file system directories in the Admin-&gt;Access area</b>




<a name="web"></a><p><div class="ramadda-help-heading">7.4.3 <a href="#web">Web Harvesters</a></div> 
The Web Harvesters work the same way as the File Harvesters but they fetch a URL (e.g., an image) every time they
run. You can also define more that one URLS to fetch . The basic Run settings, Folder and entry creation mechanisms
are the same as described above.
