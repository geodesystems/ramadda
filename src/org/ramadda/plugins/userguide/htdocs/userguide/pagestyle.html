You can control much of how the  html pages are shown using a Page Style property.
Go to the <code class="menu">Edit-&gt;Add Property</code> menu and
under "Thumbnails, Page Style, Etc." select Page Style.
The Page Style property allows you to specify what menus to show, whether to show other features and
you can also specify a WIKI text template to use for the default HTML views of the entries:

<a name="image1"></a><div class="userguide-image-centered"><a href="images/pagestyle.png"><img  src="images/pagestyle.png" border=1 alt="Page Style Create Form" ></a><br><span class="caption">Image 1: Page Style Create Form</span></div>

<ul> 
<li> Menus.
To control if the menu bar is shown and what menus get shown enter either "none" in
the menus field (to not show the menu bar) or a comma separated list of the
menus you do want to show:<pre>
file
edit
feeds
view 
other
</pre>

<b>
Note: Just so you don't lose the ability to
edit the entry the menu bar is always shown for users who have edit privileges for the
entry being displayed.
</b>
<li> Breadcrumbs: This is the breadcrumb trail of the ancestors of an entry.
<li> Show Toolbar: This is the icon toolbar (e.g., edit, delete, copy, etc)
<li> Show Entry Header: The Entry icon, name and Layout: icons
<li> Wiki Template: If defined this is the Wiki template used for the default HTML
display of the entry. See <a href="wikitext.html">wikitext.html</a> for information on
the wiki facility.
<li> Inherited: 
You can have a Page Style apply to a whole sub-tree of RAMADDA entries. Add the Page Style
property to the Folder entry and check on the Inherit flag.

</ul>

<p>
You can have any number of Page Style properties and have them apply to certain entry types
by specifying the Entry Type. For example, you can have one page style that is applicable
to File entries and one that is applicable to Folders.


<a name="templates"></a>
:h2: <a href="#templates">Page Template</a>
You can also specify which page template is used for an entry or for a whole tree. 

Go to the <code class="menu">Edit-&gt;Add Property</code> menu and under "Thumbnails, Page Style, Etc." select Page Template.  
Select the page template you want to use. You can create new <a href="templates.html">templates</a>.
If you want to have this apply to all entries under the folder then select inherit.
