You can easily aggregate collections of grids in several different ways:
<ul>
<li>Aggregate a set of grid files that form a time series into one view (JoinExisting)
<li>Aggregate a set of variables that are in different files 
which all have the same time and space dimesions (Union)
<li>Aggregate a set of ensemble members of a model into one view (Ensemble).
</ul>

To create a new grid aggregation, use the <code class="menu">File-&gt;New Entry</code> menu
and select the Grid Aggregation item under the Geo Data category.  This will 
bring up the Grid Aggregation form:

<div class="cimg"><a href="images/gridagg.gif"><img  src="images/gridagg.gif"  alt="images/gridagg.gif" ></a></div>

Options:

<ul>

<li><b>Name</b><p>Enter a name for this entry</p>

<li><b>Description</b><p>Optionally, add a description</p>

<li><b>Date Range</b><p>You can set the date range for the data.</p>

<li><b>Location</b><p>You can set the bounding box of the data location.</p>

<li><b>Aggregation type</b><p>Set the aggregation type.  The choices are:
<ul>
<li>JoinExisting - join the data along an existing time dimension.
<li>Union - join the data as a union of all the files (must have same 
temporal and spatial bounds)
<li>Ensemble - join the data as an ensemble of the individual fils (must
have same temporal and spatial bounds and fields)
</ul>
</p>

<li><b>Time Coordinate</b><p>The name of the time coordinate for the 
JoinExisting aggregation</p>

<li><b>Fields</b><p>The name(s) of the variable(s) in the files that you 
want to aggregate for the Ensemble type.</p>

<li><b>Files</b><p>If you are an administrator, you can select a set of
files on your local server (one per line) to use for this aggregation.
You need to include the full path to the files in the name. You can optionally
 leave this blank and add files to the aggregation by hand.</p>

<li><b>File Pattern</b><p>If you are an administrator, you can set a directory
name in the Files field and then give a file pattern (e.g. Foo*bar.nc) of the
files you want to include in the aggregation.</p>

<li><b>Recurse</b><p>Set to <b>Yes</b> to recurse into sub directories</p>

<li><b>Ingest Files</b><p>Ingest the metadata into the database for the
individual granules that make up the aggregation. Set this to <b>Yes</b>
if you want to show the individual granules that make up the aggregation.</p>

<li><b>Spatial/Temporal Metadata</b><p>Ingest just the spatial/temporal metadata
into the database</p>

<li><b>All Metadata</b><p>Ingest all metadata (spatial/temporal, variables, 
attributes) into the database</p>

<li><b>Owner</b><p>Specify the owner (admin) who has permission to modify
and add to this entry.</p>

</ul>

When you click on the Add Grid Aggregation button, the entry will be created.
If you specified a list of files, those will be included in the aggregation.
If you specified <b>Yes</b> to <b>Ingest Files</b>, the individual files
will be listed on entry page.
