If you have an account on a RAMADDA server you can login by following the
login link:

<div class="userguide-image-centered"><a href="images/login.png"><img  src="images/login.png" width=700 alt="images/login.png" ></a></div>

If you have forgotten your user name or password and if the RAMADDA server has been configured to send email there will be links shown to send you a reminder of your user name and to reset your password.
<p>

Once logged in there is a link <div class="img"><a href="images/user.png"><img  src="images/user.png"  alt="images/user.png" ></a></div> in the upper right which will take you to your user settings page.

<a name="settings"></a>
:h2: <a href="#settings">User Settings</a>
This page allows you to change your user settings and your password.
The Page Template is a user interface skin and allows you to change 
the overall look and feel of the user interface. If language 
translations are define then
RAMADDA also supports a per-user language setting which provides translations of phrases in the user interface.

<a name="favorites"></a>
:h2: <a href="#favorites">User Favorites</a>

The user favorites are a list of entries. 
These are kind of like bookmarks in a web browser and aid in  navigating and 
managing content.
When logged in you can add a favorite entry through the file menu.

<div class="userguide-image-centered"><a href="images/userfavorites.png"><img  src="images/userfavorites.png" width=700 alt="images/userfavorites.png" ></a></div>



<a name="datacart"></a>
:h2: <a href="#datacart">Data Cart</a>
The Data Cart facility allows you to add entries into it and serves as a 
way to make a folder of entries 
for further use (e.g., download, copy/move, delete, catalogs, etc).
The Data Cart is not persistent and is only valid for a given user session.
<p>
An entry can be added to your data cart through the entry's File menu.


<a name="monitors"></a>
:h2: <a href="#monitors">Monitors</a>
RAMADDA has a facility to define a monitor for new entries. 
A monitor consists of a set of search criteria and an action.
When a new entry is added into the repository all of the monitors are
checked. If a monitor's search criteria matches the new entry then the action is
performed.
