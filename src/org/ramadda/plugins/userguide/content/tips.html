<subhead  id="fileupload">File upload dialog</subhead>

selecting a file or drag-and-dropping a file. You can also paste an image or text into the "Or drag files here" area.

<subhead  id="wikiedit">Drag and Drop in Wiki Editor</subhead>
The wiki editor supports drag-and-drop of files. The file is uploaded to the RAMADDA server and a new
entry is created. The user is then asked what should be embedded in the wiki text, e.g.: as an
image:
[ht::cimg images/dnd.png {Drag and drop} {width=40%}]

The wiki editor also supports pasting an image that has been copied to the clipboard (e.g., through a screen grab). A new image entry is created and the above dialog is shown.


<subhead  id="inpage">Search in page</subhead>
There is a new wiki display  component that supports searching within a page.
This can be seen  in the <a href="https://ramadda.org/repository/a/maps">Maps Gallery</a>
[ht::cimg images/inpage.png {Search in page} {width=40%}]

Add this to a page with:
<pre>
{<noop>{display_simplesearch  doPageSearch=true  placeholder="Search in page"}}
</pre>

This supports grid, gallery and entry tree/table displays.




<subhead  id="fullscreen">Showing components in full-screen mode</subhead>
In wiki text add the below to provide a full screen mode. When mousing over the
component an icon <span><i class="fas fa-expand-arrows-alt"></i></span> is shown
in the upper right.
<pre>
<noop>+fullscreen
Anything here...

</pre>
