:heading Thumbnail Property
Image thumbnails are automatically created when an image is added. These can then be changed and/or deleted through the Entry-&gt;Edit Properties page. 
The Edit properties  page also allows you to
specify whether the image should be scaled down. 
Any entry, not just images,
can also have a thumbnail associated with through the Entry-&gt;Add Properties form.

Image entries support a set of Image Change functions through the Entry-&gt;Edit-&gt;Change Image

image at  a certain width.

This will run through each entry in turn and create a new thumbnail image.
