[ht::head {Registry Services}]

A RAMADDA server can register its existence with one or more other RAMADDA servers.
In this case, a RAMADDA server
that is registering itself with a registry server is known as a "registry client". 
<p>
The purpose of this is two-fold. First, this allows for a listing of RAMADDA servers so 
end users can find out about other repositories.  Secondly, as part of the registration process your
server will receive and store a list of all of the registered servers. You can then configure your RAMADDA
server to support distributed searches across a federated network of RAMADDA servers (see below).

<p>
A RAMADDA server can also be enabled to be a registry for other servers. 
We term this a "registry server".  This configuration is done through the
<i>Admin-&gt;Settings-&gt;Site and Contact Information</i> page.

<p>
A registry server provides a listing of its known clients at:<br>
<a href="https://ramadda.org/repository/registry/list">https://ramadda.org/repository/registry/list</a>

<h3>Configuration</h3>
In the <i>Admin-&gt;Settings-&gt;Site and Contact Information</i> page there is a field where you can enter one or more
registry servers, one per line. The format is:
<pre>
some password:server url
e.g.:
thepasswordforramadda:https://ramadda.org/repository
</pre>


You can also enable your server to be a registry server for other servers with the
<i>Enable this server to be a registry for other servers</i> checkbox.
You need to specify one or more passwords in a comma separated list. These are used in conjunction
with the password specified in the above list of registry servers to authenticate the registration.
<p>
When your RAMADDA server receives a list of other RAMADDA servers  as part of the registry process the server information is stored
in the database. You can configure your server to provide remote search facilities on selected servers through the 
<i>Admin-&gt;Remote Servers</i> page.
:p
In this form you can manually add new servers, delete and change existing servers and enable/disable servers.


<h3>Federated Searches</h3>
The basic registry service is used to support aggregated search across a set of RAMADDA servers.
A client server will, on successful registration with a registry server, request the collection
of client servers available from its registry server and store these in its database.
The administrator of the client server will be able to select which of the other servers
should be made available for federated search.
<p>
When there is such a collection of servers selected the Advanced Search form will have an entry
listing the servers and will allow the end user to select which, if any, of the external servers
should also be searched. When the search request is sent to the initial server if there are external
servers selected that search will also be applied to those servers.
