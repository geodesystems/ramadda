:heading Editing an entry
Once an entry is created you can edit its name, description, time range, lat/lon bounding box  and other fields with the Edit Entry link in the Edit menu:

[ht::screenshot images/entrymenu.png]

Which takes you to the Entry Edit form:

[ht::screenshot images/editform.png {Entry Edit Form}]

Normally, the description for an entry is shown within the default display for the entry's
type. Checking the <span><i class="fa-brands fa-wikipedia-w"></i></span> checkbox overrides
the default display to use description as wiki text and the editor is changed to
the wiki text editor. More information available in the <a href="wiki/wiki.html">
Wiki</a> documentation.

:heading Adding Properties
In RAMADDA entries have some basic properties that can be edited in
the edit form, e.g., name, description, lat/lon bounding box, time range, etc.
One can also add any number of other properties elements to an entry.
<p>
Clicking on the &quot;Edit Menu -&gt; Add Properties&quot; link takes you to the
Add Properties form where you can select the type of properties to add.
There are lots (and lots) of different properties. Some are basic (e.g., tags) while
some control how the repository operates (e.g,, alias, default time zone, page style, logo)

Select the type of properties to add, e.g.,  &quot;Tag&quot;.
The "inherited" flag, if checked, will have that property be applied
to all descendent entries.

You can upload a file as an attachment to an entry.
If you create a &quot;thumbnail&quot; attachment that is an image it will be displayed 
when  the entry is listed:

:heading Property Access
Access to an individual property can be controlled in the Access field. This takes the form
of a comma separated list of user IDs or roles. If a property has one or more access settings then the user must match one of the specified roles.
e.g.:
<pre>
admin,user,user:joe,role1
</pre>

<ul>
<li> admin - site administrator 
<li> user - the user is logged in
<li> user:joe  - the user id "joe"
<li> role1 - the user has the "role1" role
</ul>
