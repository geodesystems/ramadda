[ht::head {Installing RAMADDA}]

:navtop

+callout-info
There are a few things you need to figure out to install RAMADDA:
-callout

<ol>

<li> How are you going to run RAMADDA? <br>
RAMADDA  can run <a href="#standalone">stand alone</a> or under 
a servlet container like <a href="#tomcat">Tomcat</a>. 

<p>

<li> Where is RAMADDA going to store files? <br>
RAMADDA needs a <a href="#home">home directory</a> on your server to store files, databases, etc.
When RAMADDA first starts up it will create a number of directories and files in this home directory.
<p>


<li> What  database are you going to use? <br>
RAMADDA comes with its own built-in  database  (Java Derby) but 
can be easily [ug::link database.html configured] to use other databases.

<p>  

<li> Configure <a href="#ssl">https (SSL) </a> access. 

<p>

<li> Do the <a href="#final">final configuration steps through the browser</a>

<p>

<li>  Do further  <a href="#configuration">site configuration</a>.

<p>
<li> During the installation process you can install a common set of plugins to RAMADDA that provide additional functionality.
There are other [ug::link releasenotes.html#plugins plugins] available as well.
</ol>



<a name=cloud></a>
:heading Running in a Linux Cloud
We have developed an installer script that does a complete installation of Postgres and RAMADDA.
Right now this has just been tested for an Amazon AWS Linux AMI.

See [ug::link aws.html aws.html] for further details.


<a name="windows"></a>
:heading Running on Windows
RAMADDA can run on Windows. However the RAMADDA development team does not have
ready access to a Windows machine to test on so there may be some rough edges.
There have been problems reported running under Tomcat so we would suggest
running <a href="#standalone">standalone</a>.
:p
To run on Windows you will need to first install <a href="https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/How-do-I-install-Java-on-Windows">Java</a>.
Once you have Java installed consult the section on Windows in the
<a href="https://github.com/geodesystems/ramadda/blob/master/release/standalone/README">README</a>
in the RAMADDA standalone zip file.  The standalone release contains a
<a href="https://github.com/geodesystems/ramadda/blob/master/release/standalone/ramadda.bat">ramadda.bat</a>.
As described in the ramadda.bat file you set up the JAVA_HOME, RAMADDA_HOME and RAMADDA_PORT environment variables.
:p
Try running the .bat from the command line.  If it all works then you can just fire up RAMADDA by running the
.bat when you want to.
If you want to add the .bat as a service so that RAMADDA is always running you can use the NSSM application to install and
run the .bat as a
service- \[https://nssm.cc/ https://nssm.cc/\]


<a name="standalone"></a>
:heading Running Standalone
You can run RAMADDA stand-alone from the command line. This requires  Java 8 or greater. 
First you should set up a ramaddainstall directory,  e.g.:
+pre addCopy=true
mkdir  ramaddainstall
-pre

Change directory into the  <i>ramaddainstall</i> directory and
download the ramaddaserver.zip file from the 
<a  href="https://ramadda.org/repository/release/latest/ramaddaserver.zip">https://ramadda.org/repository/release/latest/ramaddaserver.zip</a>

The file download URL to use is:
+pre addCopy=true addDownload=true 
wget https://ramadda.org/repository/release/latest/ramaddaserver.zip
-pre

Once downloaded unzip the file:
+pre addCopy=true
unzip ramaddaserver.zip
-pre  

This creates a <i>ramaddaserver</i> directory that has everything that is needed to run RAMADDA.
You can consult the README.
You shouldn't have to change anything in this directory so when updating RAMADDA simply shut down
your RAMADDA server, delete the  <i>ramaddaserver</i> directory and repeat the download/unzip steps above.
:p
Copy the ramaddaenv.sh file from <i>ramaddaserver</i> into the parent directory (ramaddainstall).
This file gets sourced by ramaddaserver/ramadda.sh and defines where your RAMADDA home is,
what port RAMADDA should run on and where Java is found.

+pre addCopy=true
cp ramaddaserver/ramaddaenv.sh .
-pre

Edit this file and set the following environment variables:
+pre addCopy=true
export RAMADDA_HOME=/path/to/ramaddahome
export RAMADDA_PORT=80
export JAVA=/usr/bin/java
-pre

+callout-info
Note: Running with port 80 requires the RAMADDA process to be run as the root user.
If you do not want to run it as root for security reasons you can set the port to
a higher port (e.g., 8080).
If you do this and also have SSL enabled (as described below) the SSL port should also
be set to a high port, e.g. 8443
-callout


The minimal thing you have to do is to determine where you want the RAMADDA <a href="#home">home directory</a> to be. 
The default is <i>&lt;your home dir&gt;/.ramadda</i>. To run RAMADDA there must
be a home directory already created. When RAMADDA first runs it writes an install.properties file
in the home directory that contains an install password as below. This needs to be
entered in your browser for the final configuration.
<pre>
ramadda.install.password=&lt;some password&gt; 
</pre>


To run RAMADDA just run the script:
<pre>
sh ramaddaserver/ramadda.sh
</pre>


If not configured in ramadda.env you can specify the home directory and port as  command line arguments:
<pre>
sh ramaddaserver/ramadda.sh -home &lt;/your/ramadda/home/dir&gt; -port &lt;8080&gt;
</pre>


You can also specify the install password with
<pre>
sh ramaddaserver/ramadda.sh -home &lt;/your/ramadda/home/dir&gt; -installpassword &lt;password&gt;
</pre>


This runs with the built-in Java Derby database which work just fine.
To use an external database (e.g., Postgres, MySQL) consult the documentation.
:p

The rest of the RAMADDA configuration is done through the web at
<a href="http://localhost:8080/repository">http://localhost:8080/repository</a>.


<a name="tomcat"></a>
:heading Running under Tomcat
This assumes you have Tomcat or some other servlet (e.g., Glassfish) container already installed.

<ol>
  <li> First,  download the repository.war from the
    <a href="https://ramadda.org/repository/alias/release">ramadda.org downloads</a> site at
    <a href="https://ramadda.org/release/latest/repository.war">https://ramadda.org/release/latest/repository.war</a>.

  <li> Specify the location of the  RAMADDA <a href="#home">home directory</a> by setting the property:
<pre>
ramadda_home=/home/dir
</pre>

Either set this as an environmental or Java run time variable as  a property 
in a <i>repository.properties</i> in the ${CATALINA_HOME}/conf directory.


<li> To run under Tomcat just place the repository.war in the tomcat webapps directory. 

<li> Go to the /repository page in your browser to continue the installation process, e.g.:
http://&lt;server&gt;/repository

<li>  By default the repository is accessed at /repository on the web server. 
With Tomcat the top-level path can only be a single level and
corresponds to the name of the war file. 
If you change the top-level path for Tomcat then you also need to tell 
RAMADDA what this path is. You do that in a properties file (see below) with:
<pre>
ramadda.html.urlbase=/repository
</pre>

<li> If you get a memory error  - something like "Permgen ..." then you need to increase the 
memory allocation. in your Tomcat start up script.
Add or modify the following arguments of the JAVA_OPTS environment 
variable in the catalina start script (catalina.sh or catalina.bat):
<pre>
     -Xmx1024m 
</pre>
to set the memory and permgen size. Consult the Tomcat documentation for more information.

</ol>

<a name="home"></a>
:heading RAMADDA Home Directory

RAMADDA uses a local home directory on the server.
This is where RAMADDA looks for properties files and other resources, where the 
Java derby database is stored  (if its used) and where any uploaded data files are stored, etc. 

+callout-info
Note: the home directory needs to be owned or writable by the process that the server is running under.
If you are running Tomcat then the home directory should be owned by the Tomcat process.
-callout

<p>
By default ramadda will use: 
<pre>
&lt;server process home directory&gt;/.ramadda</pre>
i.e., the home directory of the process that is running the server (.e.g., "~", "tomcat").
<p>
You can override this by setting a <i>ramadda_home</i> property. You can do this in a number of ways:
<ol>



<li> When running stand-alone just pass the home directory as a command line argument:
<pre>
    sh ramadda.sh -Dramadda_home=&lt;home dir&gt;
Or:
    sh ramadda.sh -home &lt;home dir&gt;
</pre>


<li> As a process environment variable.<br>
Environment variables can be set for the tomcat process
Just define:<pre>
    ramadda_home=/home/dir</pre>

<li> As a Java environment variable<br>
Wherever you define the arguments that are passed to <i>java</i> when starting Tomcat include:<pre>
   -Dramadda_home=/home/dir
</pre>
e.g.:<pre>
    java -Xmx1024m   -Dramadda_home=/home/dir
</pre>


<li> RAMADDA looks for a repository.properties file under the Tomcat &quot;conf&quot; directory.
It looks for any of the environment variables
CATALINA_HOME (or CATALINA_BASE, catalina.base, catalina.home)
and  looks for a file under them, e.g.:
<pre>
${CATALINA_HOME}/conf/repository.properties
</pre>

if found then RAMADDA looks for the property: <pre>
     ramadda_home=/home/dir</pre>
</ol>


<a name="properties"></a>
<a name="final"></a>

<a name="final"></a>
:heading Browser Configuration
    Once installed and running the last steps of the configuration process are done through your browser. Go to:<pre>
<i>http://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/repository </i>
</pre>

If you are running on your local machine you go to:<pre>
<a href="http://localhost:8080/repository">http://localhost:8080/repository</a>
</pre>

To ensure only authenticated users can do this final configuration step RAMADDA will prompt for an install password.
You can find the install password on your server in:<pre>
    &lt;RAMADDA home directory&gt;/install.properties
</pre>



<a name="properties"></a>
:heading RAMADDA Property Files

For other  configuration options RAMADDA looks in its home directory for any .properties files.
While most of the RAMADDA configuration is accomplished through the web ADMIN interface there
are a number of configuration options that can be placed in a properties file, e.g. 
[ug::link database.html {database configuration}], 
<a href="#ssl">ssl options</a>, etc.
<p>
When loading properties files the first one that is loaded (if it exists) is &quot;repository.properties&quot;. 
RAMADDA will then load any
other .properties file in the home directory. It then loads any  properties files found in the 
[ug::link plugins.html plugins] directory.
<p>

To configure RAMADDA copy <a href="${root}/userguide/repository.dummy_properties">this example</a> and
rename it repository.properties. 
<p>

<a name="dopassword"></a>
For an additional layer of system security RAMADDA can be configured to
require the user's password before a site administration change or password change.
You can enable this behavior by setting the following property in your repository.properties
file
<pre>
ramadda.auth.dopassword=true
</pre>

<a name="recaptcha"></a>
RAMADDA can also make use of Google's  Recaptcha service to authenticate that the
user is indeed a real human and not a bot.
You first need to register your site with Google at
<a href=https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin>https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin</a>.
Once registered get the site key (which is public) and the secret key
and add them to your repository.properties file:


+pre addCopy=true
google.recaptcha.sitekey=
google.recaptcha.secret=
-pre

Once recaptcha is enabled you can require its use in the Admin forms by setting the below flag
+pre
ramadda.auth.dorecaptcha=true
-pre

:heading Directory Structure

Under the home directory RAMADDA will create the following subdirectories:

<ul>

<a name="htdocs"></a>
<li> htdocs<br>
This is where RAMADDA will first look for any static web content that it is serving.  If it cannot find the file here
it looks in its internal system area. So, if you want to change the system style sheet, the logo.png file or any other web
content just place it here.
<p>
Note: Files here are relative to the top-level repository path. For example, if you have a URL:<pre>
    http://yourserver.edu/repository/somefile.gif
</pre>
Then RAMADDA will strip off the &quot;repository&quot; prefix and look for a file in the RAMADDA home dir:<pre>
    htdocs/somefile.gif
</pre>

If you had a URL:<pre>
    http://yourserver.edu/repository/somedir/somefile.gif
</pre>
Then RAMADDA looks in:<pre>
    htdocs/somedir/somefile.gif
</pre>





<li> logs<br>
Holds the log files.

<li> plugins<br>
RAMADDA has a plugin mechanism and it looks in this directory for the plugins.

<li> resources<br>
This is where RAMADDA will first look for any internal resources (e.g., html template files, etc.)


<li> storage<br>
This is where the uploaded  files are stored. The directory strucuture is:<pre>
y&lt;the year&gt;/m&lt;the month&gt;/d&lt;the day&gt;/the files
</pre>
There is also an upload  directory  that holds any anonymously uploaded files.

<li>entries<br>
This is where any attachments or any other file associated with an entry (except for the actual entry file) is held.

<li> tmp<br>
A temporary file space. RAMADDA manages the scouring ,etc., of old files.

<li> derby<br>
If you are running with the Derby database this directory holds the database

</ul>



:heading Site Administration

RAMADDA for the most part can be configured through the
[ug::link admin.html {Admin pages}]. When you are logged in to 
RAMADDA as an administrator there should be a &quot;Admin&quot; on the left side of the page.
<p>
<a name="tasks"></a>
Common tasks include:
<ul>
  <li> Change the  repository title and logo in the
    [ug::link admin.html#display {Admin-&gt;Settings-&gt;Display}]
<li> Setting up an email server so RAMADDA can send email to users (e.g., for password notification). This is done on the
[ug::link admin.html#contact {Admin-&gt;Settings-&gt;Site and Contact Information}] page.
<li> Adding [ug::link adminusers.html {new users}].
<li> Creating new [ug::link newentry.html {folders and uploading files}].
<li> Defining where RAMADDA [ug::link admin.html#access {can serve files from}].
<li> Limiting [ug::link access.html access] to certain parts of the repository.
</ul>



<h3>Changing the Main Page</h3>

To change the presentation of the main entry page (the top-level RAMADDA page) you simply change the name and description
for the Entry. You do this with the <b>Edit-&gt;Edit Entry</b> menu.
<p>




<a name="ssl"></a>
:heading Configuring SSL under Tomcat
If you have your Tomcat server configured for SSL access all you need to do is to tell RAMADDA what port it is running under. Add the property:
<pre>
ramadda.ssl.port=&lt;the ssl port&gt;
</pre>
to a properties file in the RAMADDA home directory (See <a href="#properties">above</a>).
<p>

<div class="ramadda-box-yellow">
Note: When you define an SSL port then RAMADDA will automatically redirect all login and admin requests
to that port. If your Tomcat server is not really configured for SSL then you will not be able to access RAMADDA. 
See the [ug::link faq.html#fixssl FAQ] for how to fix this.
</div>


<a name="ssljetty"></a>
:heading Configuring SSL when running standalone
To configure secure SSL access to a stand-alone version of RAMADDA you need to
generate a keystore file from a certificate or generate a self-signed certificate.
If using a self-signed certificate when you first access your RAMADDA  via https
your browser will alert you to a security warning which you need to accept.
Both of these methods use Java's  <i>keytool</i> program which comes with the standard Java install.
:p
To generate a self-signed certificate from the command line run:
+pre addCopy=true
keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -keystore keystore.jks
-pre

This will prompt you for some information and a password.
There is more information <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/security/toolsign/step3.html">here</a>.



If you have an existing certificate  you need both the keytool and
<a href=https://www.openssl.org/>openssl </a> installed.
Consult <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11952274/how-can-i-create-keystore-from-an-existing-certificate-abc-crt-and-abc-key-fil>web documentation</a> on how to generate the keystore.jks file from your existing
certificate.
:p
Once you have your keystore.jks file generated copy it to the RAMADDA home directory
then specify the below configuration options 
in the install.properties file in your  RAMADDA home directory.

<pre>
ramadda.ssl.password=&lt;the password&gt;
ramadda.ssl.keypassword=&lt;the keystore password&gt;
ramadda.ssl.port=443

#You can override the location of the keystore. The default is:
#&lt;repository dir&gt;/keystore.jks
#ramadda.ssl.keystore=alternative path to keystore

#If you want to disable ssl set this to true
#ramadda.ssl.ignore=true

</pre>


<a name="letsencrypt"></a>
<h3>Using letsencrypt.org to create a certificate</h3>
If you want to have a valid signed certificate you can use
<a href=https://letsencrypt.org/>https://letsencrypt.org/</a> to create free self-signed certificate.
This requires you to have a domain name for your server's IP address and the following packages installed:
<ul>
<li> certbot-auto:  <a href=https://certbot.eff.org/docs/install.html#certbot-auto>https://certbot.eff.org/docs/install.html#certbot-auto</a>
<li> openssl: <a href=https://www.openssl.org/>https://www.openssl.org/</a>                                          <li> keytool - as described above
</ul>

Once you have a hostname and your RAMADDA running you can run a
<a href=https://github.com/geodesystems/ramadda/blob/master/bin/letsencrypt.sh>
makekestore.sh</a> script provided by RAMADDA on your server to automate the
certificate/keystore generation process and install the keystore on your RAMADDA.

Copy the script to your server and run to see the command line options.
<pre>
sh  letsencrypt.sh -help
</pre>


The only downside to using a certificate from letsencrypt is that you need to update it every 3 months.


<h3>Building RAMADDA from source</h3>
It is easy to build and run RAMADDA from Github.
The RAMADDA Gihub site is at <a href="https://github.com/geodesystems/ramadda">https://github.com/geodesystems/ramadda</a>. 

To build RAMADDA you need to have GIT, ANT and a Java compiler (1.7 or greater)  installed on your machine.
<p>
To build RAMADDA:
<ul>
<li> Check out RAMADDA from Github:

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/geodesystems/ramadda.git
</pre>

<li> Build RAMADDA.  This creates a stand-alone version in dist/ramaddaserver
<pre>
cd ramadda
ant
</pre>

<li> Run ramadda. This creates a ramadda home directory in: ~/.ramadda. 
<pre>
cd dist/ramaddaserver
sh ramadda.sh
</pre>

<li> Note: when you first run RAMADDA it will prompt you to add a installation password into a local .properties file in the RAMADDA home directory (~/.ramadda). This is for security purposes to disallow someone else from finishing the installation process on a publicly available server.

<li>  Go to <a href="http://localhost:8080/repository">http://localhost:8080/repository</a> to finish the RAMADDA install

<li>  Once configured shutdown the ramadda server (just kill the ramadda.sh run)
</ul>
