<faq>


<faqitem cxat="Logins and User Account" q="I forgot my user id. How do I retrieve it?" >
If your RAMADDA site has been configured to send email (see <a href="#email">here</a> to configure email)
then on the Login page you should see &quot;Forget your User ID?&quot; and
&quot;Forget your Password?&quot; links. 
</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="Administration" id="ssl" q="How do I configure SSL access to RAMADDA?" >
To configure SSL access see [ug::link installing.html#ssl here] if you are running under Tomcat.
See [ug::link installing.html#ssljetty here] if you are running stand-alone.
</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="Administration" id="reindex" q="The search isn't working. How do I fix it?" >
RAMADDA uses Lucene to build a search index. For some reason this index can get nuked resulting
in search not working. I (jeffmc) have been unable to replicate this problem through exhaustive
testing and code review. So, in the interim to fix this go to Admin->Maintenance and
select Reindex.
</faqitem>



<faqitem cat="Administration" id="blacklist" q="I want to blacklist certain IP address" >
  If you add a file "ipblacklist.txt" into your RAMADDA home directory the IP addresses
  in the file will be blacklisted.
  The file is if the form:
<pre>
ipaddress1
ipadddres2
ipaddres.with.wild.card*
e.g.:
190.2.132.128
89.187.164.247
78.46.9*
123.46.9*
</pre>

If a request comes in at one of the blacklisted IPs then the request is paused for a bit
and then  a 403 Forbidden  result is returned. You will need to restart your RAMADDA for
changes to take effect.
</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="Administration" id="lucene" q="How do I use Lucene for searching?" >
RAMADDA has had the ability to uses Lucene for search indexing though up until 2021 this
had been disabled by default.  Lucene provides a much better search experience as it indexes the
contents of files (e.g., pdfs, ppt, word, csv, etc) and provides better searching - supporting
entry hierarchy based searching, synonyoms, etc.

As of December 2021 RAMADDA now defaults to using Lucene. This can be overriden with the property:
<pre>
ramadda.search.lucene.enabled=false
</pre>
The problem this introduces is that, once enabled,  the index does not get built with past content so a search
will only show newly created content. To address this you can simply go to the Admin page:
Admin-&gt;Maintenance-&gt;Reindex Lucene Index and select "Reindex all".
Depending on the size of your repository this may take a few minutes but once complete your searching should be good to
go.
</faqitem>



<faqitem cat="Administration" id="allowedlogin" q="I want to restrict where users can login from" >
For security reasons you can configure what IP addresses users are allowed to login from.
In your <i>repository.properties</i> file in your local RAMADDA directory, e.g.,<pre>
&lt;home&gt;/.ramadda/repository.properties</pre>
add the property:<pre>

##Comma separated list of ip addresses (or prefixes) that are the ones where the user can login
##If blank then login is allowed from anywhere
ramadda.login.allowedips=
##e.g.:
ramadda.login.allowedips=127.0.0,201.43.72.5
</pre>
</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="Administration" id="terms" q="I want my users to agree to certain terms when they log in" >
When the following property is set then any user logging in must agree to the
given terms.
<pre>
ramadda.user.agree= Some terms
#.e.g:
ramadda.user.agree= I have read and agree to the terms of service
</pre>
</faqitem>



<faqitem cat="Administration" id="fixssl" q="Oops, I told RAMADDA to use an SSL port and SSL is not working. Now I cannot access the admin page to turn off SSL and I'm stuck. What can I do?" >
You need to comment out the ramadda.ssl.port property in your .properties file.
Alternatively, you can run RAMADDA with the command line argument:
<pre>-Dramadda.ssl.ignore=true</pre>
</faqitem>

<faqitem cat="Administration" q="I forgot the administrator password and cannot access RAMADDA. How do I login?" >

The easiest way is to set a username/password  in the repository.properties file in the 
RAMADDA home directory. Just add:<pre>
ramadda.admin=userid:password
</pre>
and then restart RAMADDA. This sets the password for the given userid.
Note: you should remove this entry once you have reset your password.

<p>
You can also specify an administrator user id and password from the command line when starting RAMADDA.
If you are running RAMADDA stand alone then just provide the arguments:<pre>
-admin &lt;user id&gt; &lt;password&gt;
</pre>
This creates a new user id if needed and sets the password.
<p>
If you are running RAMADDA under Tomcat then change the web.xml to pass in command line arguments
using the &quot;args&quot; entry. This is a comma separated value list of the command line arguments
that are processed by RAMADDA.
<pre>
    &lt;param-name&gt;args&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;-admin,userid,password&lt;/param-value&gt;
</pre>

</faqitem>




<faqitem cat="Administration" id="hostname" q="I set the hostname to an incorrect hostname. Now I can't login?" >
Make a &lt;anyname&gt;.properties that contains:
<pre>
override.ramadda.hostname=&lt;good host name&gt;
</pre>
and place it in your ramadda home directory or plugins directory and restart ramadda. 
Once you are logged in go to the Admin Settings page and change the hostname then remove
the properties file.
<p>
In general, you can override any property that has been set by defining a property with the "override." prefix.

</faqitem>

<faqitem cat="Administration" id="hostnamemap" q="Map a hostname to some entry">
You can configure your RAMADDA so that access via some specific hostname (e.g. <a href="http://boulderdata.org/">http://boulderdata.org/</a>) uses some entry.

To do this first set a server property to enable this and restart your RAMADDA.
<pre>
ramadda.enable_hostname_mapping = true
</pre>

Then add an Alias property to the entry of interest with the value:
<pre>
http://your_hostname
e.g.:
http://boulderdata.org
</pre>

If you had different domains you can add multiple aliases -
<pre>
http://www.boulderdata.org
</pre>

This will use the entry as the root when accessing the repository under the given hostname. For example, the site
<a href="http://boulderdata.org/">http://boulderdata.org/</a> really just maps to an entry at - 
<a href="https://ramadda.org/repository/entry/show?entryid=79f24329-8c98-4d15-9804-821a70bfb606">https://ramadda.org/repository/entry/show?entryid=79f24329-8c98-4d15-9804-821a70bfb606</a>.

Note: when searching under the alias the whole site will be searched.

</faqitem>



<faqitem cat="Administration" id="email" q="How do I configure RAMADDA to send email?" >
RAMADDA can send email for both the password reset process and for monitoring new entries.
On the main Site Administration  page under the &quot;Contact&quot; area you can specify
a SMTP server that RAMADDA will use to send email.
</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="Administration" id="sitemap" q="How do I create a site map?" >
For more effective  indexing of your site RAMADDA provides a 
built-in site map API:
<pre>
/repository/sitemap.xml
</pre>
By default this lists all of the entries under the top-level entry.
<p>
If you want specific entries in your site map then simply
add an "Is in Site Map" property (Under the Add Property-&gt;
Thumbnails, Page Style, Etc.) menu for the entry or entries.
</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="Administration" id="metadata" q="Disabling selected metadata types" >
You can configure your RAMADDA to not include certain metadata types. This can be done by the ID of the metadata type
or its category. Set the following property:  
<pre>
#e.g., don't include the enum_tag or any metadata under the cateegory Bio or THREDDS
#These can either be a specific string or a regexp pattern
ramadda.metadata.nottypes=enum_tag,category:Bio.*,category:THREDDS                                                                                              
</pre>
</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="Administration" id="github" q="Enable github embeds" >
The wiki facility supports embedding github commit history. github rate limites requests so your
repository can only make a few requests at a time. You can increase this rate limit by creating a github
personal access token at: <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">https://github.com/settings/tokens</a>.
Add the property to your .properties file:
<pre>
github.token=&lt;your token&gt;
</pre>  
</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="Administration" id="template" q="I want to change the html design of RAMADDA" >
See the [ug::link templates.html documentation].
</faqitem>



<faqitem cat="Administration" id="maxentries" q="How do I change the default number of children entries?" >
To configure the default number of children entries shown set the property:
<pre>
ramadda.defaultmaxentries=1000
</pre>
</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="Administration" id="template" q="Changing the initial welcome text and entries" >
When RAMADDA is first installed it populates your repository with some initial folders and sets the description
of the root entry with some initial text. You can override what entries are created and what the text is (for example, if
you wanted to configure a number of different RAMADDA servers).

<p>
To change the description used just create a file <i>initdescription.txt</i> in the RAMADDA home directory. This file, if it exists,
is read by RAMADDA. You can see the default one in the source tree at:
<pre>
src/org/ramadda/repository/resources/examples/initdescription.txt
</pre>

This file contains 2 macros:<pre>
$<filler>{root} - the top-level URL path
$<filler>{topid} - the ID of the root entry
</pre>

To change what entries are created RAMADDA looks for a <i>initentries.xml</i> file in the RAMADDA home directory. The default file is:
<pre>
src/org/ramadda/repository/resources/examples/initentries.xml
</pre>


This is just the entries xml format. The ID of the top-level entry is simply "root", e.g.:
<pre>
&lt;entries&gt;
&lt;entry parent="root" name="Projects" type="group"&gt;
&lt;description&gt;A place to store projects&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/entry&gt;
&lt;/entries&gt;
</pre>

</faqitem>

<faqitem cat="Administration" id="characterset" q="Running with non-ascii characters" >
There are a number of things you will need to do to run with content that is non-ascii (e.g., Chinese characters).
<p>
For Tomcat  set the URIEncoding:
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/138948/how-to-get-utf-8-working-in-java-webapps">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/138948/how-to-get-utf-8-working-in-java-webapps</a>.

<p>

If you are running mysql there are some <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=utf-8+mysql&btnG=Search">things</a> you need to do. Postgres and Derby seem OK out of the box.

<p>

Your Java runtime should also have the system property -Dfile.encoding=utf-8  defined.

</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="Administration" id="formopen" q="How do I configure the entry table to always show the Apply action form?" >
  The entry table has an &quot;Apply action&quot; header form that is normally toggled off. To change this
  default behavior set the RAMADDA property (either in a repository.properties file or through the
  Admin interface)
<pre>
ramadda.wiki.table.formopen=true
</pre>

</faqitem>





<faqitem cat="Administration" id="missing" q="I've cleaned up files on my server that I had harvested in RAMADDA. How do I delete those entries in RAMADDA?" >


If you have harvested files into RAMADDA from your server file system and subsequently delete those files (e.g., scouring a real-time archive) RAMADDA will not delete the corresponding entries automatically. Instead, by default, RAMADDA will not show those kinds of entries to non logged in users but will show them to logged in users. However, no file download is available because the file is missing.

To clean up these entries in RAMADDA you can manually delete the entries or you can set a property to automatically delete these types of entries.

<pre>
ramadda.delete_entry_when_file_is_missing=true
</pre>

<b>
Be careful with this. I (jeffmc) have seen remote file systems go down momentarily and if this had been set then all of my entries that I had harvested would have been deleted.
</b>


</faqitem>





<faqitem id="checkbox" q="How do I select multiple checkboxes at once?">
In RAMADDA when there is a collection of checkboxes in a form (e.g., in the entry list or in the edit metadata form)
selecting one and then
selecting another with a Shift-Click toggles the range of checkboxes between the first the second
checkbox clicked. Doing a Control-Click on a checkbox toggles all of them on or off.
