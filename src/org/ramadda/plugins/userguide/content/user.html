[ht::head {Logging in and User Settings}]

<%nochildlist%>


If you have an account on a RAMADDA server you can login by following the
login link:

[ht::cimg images/login.png {} {width=700}]

If you have forgotten your user name or password and if the RAMADDA server has been configured to send email there will be links shown to send you a reminder of your user name and to reset your password.
<p>

Once logged in there is a link [ht::img images/user.png] in the upper right which will take you to your user settings page.

:heading User Settings
<subhead  id="settings"  intoc="false">User Settings</subhead>
This page allows you to change your user settings and your password.
The Page Template is a user interface skin and allows you to change 
the overall look and feel of the user interface. 


[ht::cimg images/usersettings.png {} {width=700}]


<subhead  id="favorites"  intoc="false">User Favorites</subhead>

The user favorites are a list of entries. 
These are kind of like bookmarks in a web browser and aid in  navigating and 
managing content.
When logged in you can add a favorite entry through the file menu.
