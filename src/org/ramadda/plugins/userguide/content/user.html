If you have forgotten your user name or password and if the RAMADDA server has been configured to send email there will be links shown to send you a reminder of your user name and to reset your password.

Once logged in there is a link <i class="fas fa-user" title="Settings for Administrator"></i>
in the upper right which will take you to your user settings page.

<subhead  id="settings"  intoc="false">User Settings</subhead>

The user favorites are a list of entries. 
These are kind of like bookmarks in a web browser and aid in  navigating and

When logged in you can add a favorite entry through the file menu.
