[ht::head {Logging in and User Settings}]

<%nochildlist%>

If you have an account on a RAMADDA server you can login by following the
login link:

[ht::cimg images/login.png {} {width=700}]

If you have forgotten your user name or password and if the RAMADDA server has been configured to send email there will be links shown to send you a reminder of your user name and to reset your password.
<p>

Once logged in there is a link (:ht::img images/user.png] in the upper right which will take you to your user settings page.

<subhead  id="favorites"  intoc="false">User Settings</subhead>

[ht::cimg images/userhome.png {} {width=700}]


The initial tag lists all of your &quot;favorite&quot; entries.
These are kind of like bookmarks in a web browser and, when they exist,
always show on every page in the left column. Whenever you are viewing an
entry you can add it as a favorite with the <img src="images/favorite.gif"> icon
shown in the upper right toolbar.

<subhead  id="settings"  intoc="false">User Settings</subhead>
This tab allows you to change your user settings and your password.
The Page Template is a user interface skin and allows you to change the overall 
look and feel of the user interface. If language translations are define then
RAMADDA also supports a per-user language setting which provides translations of phrases
in the user interface.


<subhead  id="datacart"  intoc="false">Data Cart</subhead>
The Data Cart facility allows you to add entries into it and serves as a wayy to make a folder of entries 
for further use (e.g., download, copy/move, delete, catalogs, etc).
The Data Cart is not persistent and is only valid for a given user session.
<p>
Any time you see an entry you can add it to your cart with the <img src="images/cart_add.png"> icon
shown in the upper right toolbar.


<subhead  id="monitors"  intoc="false">Monitors</subhead>
RAMADDA has a facility to define a monitor for new entries. 
A monitor consists of a set of search criteria and an action.
When a new entry is added into the repository all of the monitors are
checked. If a monitor's search criteria matches the new entry then the action is
performed.
