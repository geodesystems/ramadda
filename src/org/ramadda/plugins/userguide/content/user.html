[ht::head {Logging in and User Settings}]

<%nochildlist%>

If you have an account on a RAMADDA server you can login by following the
login link:

[ht::cimg images/login.png {} {width=700}]

If you have forgotten your user name or password and if the RAMADDA server has been configured to send email there will be links shown to send you a reminder of your user name and to reset your password.
<p>

Once logged in there is a link [ht::img images/user.png] in the upper right which will take you to your user settings page.

<subhead  id="settings"  intoc="false">User Settings</subhead>
This page allows you to change your user settings and your password.
The Page Template is a user interface skin and allows you to change 
the overall look and feel of the user interface. If language 
translations are define then
RAMADDA also supports a per-user language setting which provides translations of phrases in the user interface.

<subhead  id="favorites"  intoc="false">User Favorites</subhead>

The user favorites are a list of entries. 
These are kind of like bookmarks in a web browser and aid in  navigating and 
managing content.
When logged in you can add a favorite entry through the file menu.

[ht::cimg images/userfavorites.png {} {width=700}]



<subhead  id="datacart"  intoc="false">Data Cart</subhead>
The Data Cart facility allows you to add entries into it and serves as a 
way to make a folder of entries 
for further use (e.g., download, copy/move, delete, catalogs, etc).
The Data Cart is not persistent and is only valid for a given user session.
<p>
An entry can be added to your data cart through the entry's File menu.


<subhead  id="monitors"  intoc="false">Monitors</subhead>
RAMADDA has a facility to define a monitor for new entries. 
A monitor consists of a set of search criteria and an action.
When a new entry is added into the repository all of the monitors are
checked. If a monitor's search criteria matches the new entry then the action is
performed.
