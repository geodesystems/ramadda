RAMADDA provides an Integrated Map Data Viewer (IMDV) entry type that supports the creation
of rich interactive maps.
There are lots of examples on <a href=https://ramadda.org/repository/a/imdv>ramadda.org</a>.

:br
:heading Create a New Map

From the entry menu choose "Pick a Type...". Under GIS Data select "Integrated Map Data":

[ht::cimg images/new.png {New Entry}]

Enter a name for your map. You can ignore the file. Enter some description.
Note: the description is wiki text.
[ht::screenshot images/newform.png {New Map Form}]

Once created you will have the initial display below. The File menu allows you to save
changes to your map. The Edit menu 

[ht::screenshot images/imdv1.png {Initial Display}]

:br
:heading Basic Editing

Select the New menu to see the different map glyph types that can be added. 
There are basic shapes - Marker, Label, Lines, Box, etc. 
[ht::screenshot images/newmenu.png {New Menu}]

Selecting a shape click and/or click-drag in the map to create the shape.
Once something is created in the map a legend is shown on the left.
[ht::screenshot images/imdv2.png]

Clicking on the toggle arrow (<i class="fas fa-caret-down" style=""></i>)
shows more details for the glyph. The <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> link
takes brings up an edit window for that glyph. This allows you to specify
the drawing style and other properties. 
[ht::screenshot images/edit1.png]

The Edit Menu allows you to select glyphs, cut/copy/paste, etc.

:heading Adding a Map
The IMDV supports adding a number of map files - GeoJson, GPX and Shapefile.
First upload the file to RAMADDA as a regular file entry.
The IMDV entry can act as a folder so you can upload the file under the IMDV or elsewhere
in your RAMADDA.
:p
Next, select New-&gt;Map File and select the
map file.
Then from the IMDV New menu, select "Map". The Map Entry selector will be shown:
Navigated through your RAMADDA entry hierarchy and select the map file.
[ht::screenshot images/newmap.png]

Once added the IMDV will zoom to the map area. If there are properties defined in your map file
then a Filters area  will shown. These allow you to toggle on/off the map features. You can save
this state (through the File/Save menu). 
[ht::screenshot images/maplegend.png]

:p
There are a number of ways to configure the display of the map file.
Bring up the map settings with the
<i class="fas fa-cog" style="color:#ccc;"></i> link.
:p
The Popup Text can contain arbitrary HTML as well as macros corresponding to the properties in the map file.
Note: the source names of the source properties are cleaned up and lower-cased to get the property IDs
used in these settings.
:p
e.g.:
<pre>
Some HTML text ${some_property} &lt;br&gt;
Department: ${department}  &lt;br&gt;
Code: ${code}
</pre>

<a name=featureflags></a>
The Feature Flags section allows you to control what search properties are shown.
For example, say your map file has a property called "some_property" as well as
a number of other properties. To turn off showing any filter enter:
<pre>
filter.show=false
</pre>

If you only want to show the filter for the some_property property then enter:
<pre>
filter.show=false
#form:
#&lt;property name&lt;.filter.show=true
#e.g.:
some_property.filter.show=true
</pre>

The IMDV guesses as to what type of data is a property and provides an appropriate search widget.
If you want to force the search widget to be a different type you can enter:
<pre>
some_property.filter.type=enumeration
</pre>

Many times the property name is less then useful as a label. You can specify a label with:
<pre>
#&lt;property name&lt;.label=some label
#e.g.:
some_property.label=A formatted label
</pre>

The <b>Style</b> section of the settings dialog lets you specify the standard set of map styles, e.g.,
stroke color, stroke width, fill color, etc. The <b>Map Style Rules</b> section
allows you to specify
:p
With  <b>Fill Colors</b> checked the map polygons will be colored with a set of categorical colors.
:p
The <b>Map value to fill color</b> and <b>Map value to stroke color</b> allows you to specify
a property that is mapped into a colortable. If it is a numeric property then you can also
specify a min/max range.
:p
The <b>Style Rules</b> allows you to specify specific property value tests mapped to a set of styles.
Mouse over the styles to see the format
:p
The <b>Map Labels</b> section allows you to specify a template (similar to the popup text) for a label
for each polygon.
:p
The <b>Map Style Groups</b>  section allows you to specify one or more groups and the corresponding styles
for those groups. This enables you to "paint" specific polygons in the map.
These groups will show up in the legend. Selecting a group in the legend and then selecting
a polygon in the map will add that polygon to the group.
:p
For example, in the below map of fire evacuation zones 2 style groups have been created "Evacuation" and
"Pre-Evacuation". Selecting on one of those groups in the legend allows you to select specific polygons
in the map to color those polygons.

:br
:heading Adding an Image
You can add a georeferenced image to your IMDV.
There are 4 ways to initiate adding an image:
* Drag and drop an image file onto the map. You will be prompted for the new image entry name and the image file will be added as a child entry of the imdv map
* Paste and image from the clipboard. This will behave like drag-and-drop.
* Upload an image to RAMADDA beforehand. Select New-&gt;Image from the IMDV menu and select the image entry
* Select New-&gt;Image from the IMDV menu and enter the URL to the image
Once an image is selected you drag an area on the map. 
:p
Here we're going to add in a aerial photo taken in 1937 of the Boulder Colorado area.
First upload the image to RAMADDA. Then in the IMDV navigate to the area of interest.
Then do New-&gt;Image and choose the  image:
[ht::screenshot images/newimage.png]

Click and drag out a region. The IMDV will maintain the aspect ratio of the image.
Pressing the shift key while dragging will set the image region to the drag rectangle.
Once added you can change the opacity of the image with the Image Opacity slider or from the
image edit settings. This allows you to see what is underneath the image. From
the Edit menu choose Reshape and click on the image. This lets you change the area and shape
of the image. Note: not all imagery will be in the projection of the underlying map so
georeferencing  the image can be inexact.

:p
:heading Adding a Route
If your RAMADDA is <a href=/repository/userguide/keys.html#otherapis>enabled</a>
then a Route glyph type will be shown in the New menu.
Select the desired provider (here.com or google) and the route type:
[ht::screenshot images/newroute.png]

Click and draw a multi-segment line. Double clicking to end.
The route will be shown. The legend shows the calculated distance:
[ht::screenshot images/route.png]


:br
:heading Entry Markers 
The Entry Marker and the Multi Entry allow you to add markers
for RAMADDA entries. Clicking on the marker will show some content
from that entry.
For example, RAMADDA supports 3D Models as an entry type. 
Choosing New-&gt;Entry Marker and adding it to the map will add a marker. Clicking on that marker
will show a 3D view of the model:
[ht::screenshot images/entrymarker.png]

When adding a marker for an entry  that has geolocation you will be prompted if you want to
use the entry's latitide/longitude as the position for the marker or if you want to position
the marker manually. If you opt to use the entry's position then, if the position of the entry
is changed, that change is reflected in the  map. You can manually move the marker and that new
position will then be used. Likewise, the name and label for the marker is taken from the entry
name. If the name of the entry changes then that will be reflected in the map. This can be changed
by bringing up the properties for the entry marker:
[ht::screenshot images/entrymarker2.png]

<a name=glyphs></a>
An entry marker  for an entry that provides point data can also show a display of
the most recent record in the data directly within the map. e.g.:
[ht::screenshot images/glyphs1.png]

This  is done by specifiy one or more "glyphs"  in the properties for the marker:
[ht::screenshot images/glyphs2.png]

The first line as shown above specifies the width and height and fill for the canvas.
<pre>
width=120;height=100;fill=#efefef;border=#000
</pre>
Each successive line specifes the glyphs.
The glyphs take the same form as the 
<a href=wikidisplay2.html#canvas>Canvas Display</a> provides. One way to configure the
glyphs used in the map is to first add a canvas display directly for the source entry as shown below.
Right clicking in the display_canvas tag brings up a context menu that has examples
for the different types of glyphs.
<pre>
{{display_canvas  canvasWidth=100 canvasHeight=100  lastRecords=1
glyph1="type:3dbar,pos:sw,dx:10,dy:-5,height:100,width:8,baseHeight:5,sizeBy:atmos_temp,sizeByMin:0,sizeByMax:50"
glyph2="type:label,font:6pt,pos:ne,dx:90,dy:-90,label:Temp: \${atmos_temp}" 
}}
</pre>


The Multi Entry allows you to select some Folder in RAMADDA. All of the geolocated children entries
in that folder will be shown in the map. For example, if you had a Folder of a number of map files
add the folder as a Multi Entry. This adds markers for each map file. Clicking on a marker shows
the view of the entry (like above). In the legend clicking on the <i class="fas fa-plus"></i> link
will add that entry as a map into the main map.

:br
:heading Adding Data Displays
RAMADDA provides very rich capabilities to show data in maps, e.g.
on <a href=https://ramadda.org/repository/a/maps>ramadda.org</a>.
These displays are accomplished through RAMADDA's <a href=wiki.html>wiki</a>
facility. You can import one or more map data  displays into an IMDV.
:p
First, upload your data to RAMADDA and create a map display for that data
using RAMADDA's <a href=wiki.html>wiki</a> facility.
Next, from the IMDV New menu select Data and select the data you uploaded.
The IMDV will extract from you data's wiki the arguments for a map display.
These will be shown and can be edited if needed. Here we've selected some aircraft
track data:
[ht::screenshot images/newdata.png]

With the result map:
[ht::screenshot images/data1.png]

The map display properties can be edited through the Edit form.
Other  data displays can be added and overlaid on the IMDV map.
:p
You can play around with this by importing the file 
<a href=Showing_data_in_maps.zip>Showing_data_in_maps.zip</a>
to your RAMADDA. This is an export of the example showing Colorado aircraft crashes and
Colorado mines on
<a href=https://ramadda.org/repository/entry/show?entryid=a4ba9818-b8ed-4512-9cfb-f81d6e44acba>
ramadda.org</a>.
