Selecting a shape click and/or click-drag in the map to create the shape.
Once something is created in the map a legend is shown on the left.
Here we have created a Group called "Some Group", a Marker, a Box and a Freehand glyph.
The glyphs in the legend can be dragged and dropped to reorder. You can also
drag a glyph onto a Group to add the glyph to the group.

:heading Properties Dialog
Clicking on the toggle arrow (<i class="fas fa-caret-down" style=""></i>)
shows more details for the glyph. The <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> link
takes brings up an edit window for that glyph. This allows you to specify
the drawing style and other properties. 
:p
The main Properties tab allows you to change the name of the glyph,
toggle the visibility and specify what zoom levels this glyph is
visible in. This allows you to, for example, specify that when the
map is zoomed out the glyph won't be shown.
The popup text is the text shown when the user clicks on the glyph.
The legend text is just extra text shown in the legend.

The Flags tab allows you to specify a number of extra flags or properties
for this glyph. For example, below the showButtons and showMeasures are both set to
false. With showButtons the button links in the legend won't be shown for non-logged in users.
The showMeasure=false says to not show the distance and dimensions in the legend.

The Style tab provides settings that control the drawing style of the glyph.
These settings can vary depending on the type of the glyph.
The Active button, if set, will apply the style to the glyph when it is changed in the form.

[ht::screenshot images/properties_style.png]

The style tab for the Group will contain all possible styles.
Clicking on the <i class="fas fa-folder-tree"></i> icon for any one style will apply
that style to all of the contained glyphs within the group.
