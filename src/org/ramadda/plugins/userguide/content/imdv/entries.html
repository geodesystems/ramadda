:heading Entry Markers 
The Entry Marker and the Multi Entry allow you to add markers
for RAMADDA entries. Clicking on the marker will show some content
from that entry.
For example, RAMADDA supports 3D Models as an entry type. 
Choosing New-&gt;Entry Marker and adding it to the map will add a marker. Clicking on that marker
will show a 3D view of the model:

When adding a marker for an entry  that has geolocation you will be prompted if you want to
use the entry's latitide/longitude as the position for the marker or if you want to position
the marker manually. If you opt to use the entry's position then, if the position of the entry
is changed, that change is reflected in the  map. You can manually move the marker and that new
position will then be used. Likewise, the name and label for the marker is taken from the entry
name. If the name of the entry changes then that will be reflected in the map. This can be changed
by bringing up the properties for the entry marker:

The Multi Entry allows you to select some Folder in RAMADDA. All of the geolocated children entries
in that folder will be shown in the map. For example, if you had a Folder of a number of map files
add the folder as a Multi Entry. This adds markers for each map file. Clicking on a marker shows
the view of the entry (like above). In the legend clicking on the <i class="fas fa-plus"></i> link
will add that entry as a map into the main map.

:heading Data Icons
An entry marker  for an entry that provides point data can also show a display of
the most recent record in the data directly within the map. e.g.:
[ht::screenshot images/glyphs1.png]

This  is done by specifiy one or more "glyphs"  in the properties for the marker:
[ht::screenshot images/glyphs2.png]

The first line as shown above specifies the width and height and fill for the canvas.
<pre>
width=120;height=100;fill=#efefef;border=#000
</pre>
Each successive line specifes the glyphs.
The glyphs take the same form as the 
<a href=wikidisplay2.html#canvas>Canvas Display</a> provides. One way to configure the
glyphs used in the map is to first add a canvas display directly for the source entry as shown below.
Right clicking in the display_canvas tag brings up a context menu that has examples
for the different types of glyphs.
<pre>
{{display_canvas  canvasWidth=100 canvasHeight=100  lastRecords=1
glyph1="type:3dbar,pos:sw,dx:10,dy:-5,height:100,width:8,baseHeight:5,sizeBy:atmos_temp,sizeByMin:0,sizeByMax:50"
glyph2="type:label,font:6pt,pos:ne,dx:90,dy:-90,label:Temp: \${atmos_temp}" 
}}
</pre>




:heading Data Displays
RAMADDA provides very rich capabilities to show data in maps, e.g.
on <a href=https://ramadda.org/repository/a/maps>ramadda.org</a>.
These displays are accomplished through RAMADDA's <a href=../wiki.html>wiki</a>
facility. You can import one or more map data  displays into an IMDV.
:p
First, upload your data to RAMADDA and create a map display for that data
using RAMADDA's <a href=wiki.html>wiki</a> facility.
Next, from the IMDV New menu select Data and select the data you uploaded.
The IMDV will extract from you data's wiki the arguments for a map display.
These will be shown and can be edited if needed. Here we've selected some aircraft
track data:
[ht::screenshot images/newdata.png]

With the result map:
[ht::screenshot images/data1.png]

The map display properties can be edited through the Edit form.
Other  data displays can be added and overlaid on the IMDV map.
:p
You can play around with this by importing the file 
<a href=https://ramadda.org/repository/a/userguide_showing_data_in_maps>https://ramadda.org/repository/a/userguide_showing_data_in_maps</a>
to your RAMADDA. This is an export of the example showing Colorado aircraft crashes and
Colorado mines on
<a href=https://ramadda.org/repository/entry/show?entryid=a4ba9818-b8ed-4512-9cfb-f81d6e44acba>
ramadda.org</a>.
