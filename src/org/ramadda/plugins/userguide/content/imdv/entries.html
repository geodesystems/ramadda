:heading Entry Markers 
The Entry Marker and the Multi Entry allow you to add markers
for RAMADDA entries. Clicking on the marker will show some content
from that entry.
For example, RAMADDA supports 3D Models as an entry type. 
Choosing New-&gt;Entry Marker and adding it to the map will add a marker. Clicking on that marker
will show a 3D view of the model:

When adding a marker for an entry  that has geolocation you will be prompted if you want to
use the entry's latitide/longitude as the position for the marker or if you want to position
the marker manually. If you opt to use the entry's position then, if the position of the entry
is changed, that change is reflected in the  map. You can manually move the marker and that new
position will then be used. Likewise, the name and label for the marker is taken from the entry
name. If the name of the entry changes then that will be reflected in the map. This can be changed
by bringing up the properties for the entry marker:

:heading Data Displays
RAMADDA provides very rich capabilities to show data in maps, e.g.
on <a href=https://ramadda.org/repository/a/maps>ramadda.org</a>.
These displays are accomplished through RAMADDA's <a href=../wiki.html>wiki</a>
facility. You can import one or more map data  displays into an IMDV.
:p
First, upload your data to RAMADDA and create a map display for that data
using RAMADDA's <a href=wiki.html>wiki</a> facility.
Next, from the IMDV New menu select Data and select the data you uploaded.
The IMDV will extract from you data's wiki the arguments for a map display.
These will be shown and can be edited if needed. Here we've selected some aircraft
track data:

With the result map:

The map display properties can be edited through the Edit form.
Other  data displays can be added and overlaid on the IMDV map.
:p
You can play around with this by importing the file 
<a href=https://ramadda.org/repository/a/userguide_showing_data_in_maps>https://ramadda.org/repository/a/userguide_showing_data_in_maps</a>
to your RAMADDA. This is an export of the example showing Colorado aircraft crashes and
