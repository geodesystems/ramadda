:heading Showing Purple Air sensor data
Here we  describe how to show a collection of Purple Air
sensors in an IMDV  map that is similar to 
\[https://ramadda.org/repository/entry/show?entryid=1b46ed12-9581-4a33-be23-0bb913f13328 this one\].

You can download and import this example into your RAMADDA with this .zip file-
<a href="https://ramadda.org/repository/a/userguide_purpleair">https://ramadda.org/repository/a/userguide_purpleair</a>. This import contains the IMDV map shown here as well as
a number of Purple Air sensor entries.
Alternatively, you can use your own collection of Purple Air sensor entries and create
an <a href=introduction.html>IMDV entry</a>.

:heading Creating a Multi-Entry glyph

First, create a new "Multi Entry" glyph under the New menu
[ht::screenshot images/newmultientry.png {}]


In the Select Entry form select the Purple Air Sensors folder that holds your sensor entries.
Note: the Multi-entry glyph can show any collection of entries.

You should have a default map that just shows the entry icons. Clicking on an icon will
show the Purple Air time series.
