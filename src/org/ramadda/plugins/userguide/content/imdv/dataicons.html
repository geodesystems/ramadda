To enable data icon displays bring up the Properties dialog for the relevant glyph
(this may be a Multi-Entry, an Entry Marker or a Group)
<i class="fas fa-cog" style="color:#ccc;"></i> in the legend:

Under the Data Icons tab select "Show data as icons" and press OK. 
Your map should now show the sensor data.

You should have a map that looks like below.  From the top-level File menu select Save.

:heading Adding a field select menu
You can add a pull down menu at the top of the page that allows the user to select which field
is displayed. To do this you will first need to know what are the field identifiers for
the data entry. Navigate to one of the data entrys you will be displaying, e.g., the Purple Air sensor and view the Metadata page (from the entry's popup menu) to show the metadata. Note the
fields you want to use. For Purple Air we are going to use pm1.0, pm2.5 and pm10.0.

Now, back to the IDMV map, bring up the properties dialog for the multi-entry. Under the Menu Fields
add the fields you want to use. Optionally you can specify an initial field and a menu label.

You should now have a menu shown that allows you to select the field to display:

[ht::cimg images/multientrymap2.png {} {width=600px}]

You can specify an alternative label to show in the menu as below by specifying a
label=... property in the Menu Fields:
