<h2>Installing on Amazon AWS</h2>

+callout-info
Here are the steps to install the stand-alone version of RAMADDA on an AWS instance. 
-callout

:heading Create an EC2 Instance
<ol>
<li> From the EC2 Dashboard (e.g., <a href="https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home">https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home</a>)
go to the  Instances page and select  "Launch Instance".

<li> Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)<br>
Pick a standard Amazon Linux 3 AMI image. 
+callout-info
Note: The installer does not work on the Amazon Linux 2023 AMI image
as that image does not support the amazon-linux-extras package manager.
-callout


+callout-info
Note: RAMADDA can run on REDHAT Linux but the installer has not been fully tested. 
-callout
  
<li> Choose an Instance Type<br>
The instance type depends on your expected load. For example 
<a href="https://ramadda.org">https://ramadda.org</a> runs on a t2.medium but a 
t2.micro or t2.small works just fine.

<li> Key pair<br>
Select "Create new key pair". 
This is what you use to SSH to your instance. Do not lose it!
Once downloaded, you will need to change permissions on your pem file, e.g.
<pre>
chmod 600 ramadda.pem
</pre>
  

<li>Network settings<br>
You should allow SSH, HTTPS and HTTP traffic to your server


<li>Add Storage<br>
The instance comes with a smallish root volume where /home is mounted. 
You should add a new volume. 
The model that we follow is to have an additional large size volume that will hold
RAMADDA's home directory, uploaded files and database. 
The size depends on the expected size of your RAMADDA use.
For example, for the <a href="https://ramadda.org">https://ramadda.org</a> 
repository (which has a ton of content) the database size is ~4GB and the files take up ~20GB.



<li> Review Instance Launch<br>
   
<li> Elastic IPS (optional) <br>
By default the IP address associated with your instance can change when the instance is stopped and restarted. You can use the AWS Elastic IP service to create a permanent IP address for your instance. In the AWS console under Network and Security select "Elastic IPs".   Next, select "Allocate Elastic IP address" to create a new IP address. Then associate the IP address with your new instance.

</ol>



:heading Configure your instance
Once your instance is running here are the steps to configure and install RAMADDA.
<ol>
<li> From the Instances page view the details of your instance to see its IPv4 Public IP

<li> SSH to your instance using the PEM file:
<pre>
ssh -i &lt;.pem file&gt;  ec2-user@&lt;server IP address&gt;
</pre>


<li> It is best to update the instance:
<pre>
sudo yum update -y
</pre>

<li> Fetch then unzip the RAMADDA installer:
+pre addCopy=true
wget -O ramaddainstaller.zip https://ramadda.org/repository/release/latest/ramaddainstaller.zip
unzip ramaddainstaller.zip
-pre

<li> Run the installer - make sure to give it the absolute path:
+pre addCopy=true
sudo bash ramaddainstaller/awsinstall.sh
-pre

</ol>

The installer will walk you through a number of installation steps to setup the directories, and install and configure
Java, Postgres and the RAMADDA server.


The installer will:
<ul>
<li> Mount the EBS volume as <i>/mnt/ramadda</i>

<li> Install and configure PostgreSQL. A ramadda user and a repository database will be created.
  The database will be stored at: 
<i>/mnt/ramadda/pgsql</i> and which is linked to
from <i>/var/lib/pgsql</i>

<li> Download and install RAMADDA. 

<li> Configure RAMADDA with a (temporary) self-signed certificate for HTTPS access.

<li> Install RAMADDA as a service. To start and stop RAMADDA do:

</ul>

Once running you need to finish the configuration through the RAMADDA web interface:
<pre>
https://&lt;IP address&gt;/repository
</pre>
The install process will display an installation password that you enter through the web interface.
Note: since the SSL certificate is self-signed your browser will display a warning when accessing the site.



:heading Server files

The install will result in:
<pre>
/home/ec2-user/ramaddainstaller - The installer
/home/ec2-user/ramaddainstaller/update.sh - A script to run to update your RAMADDA server. Run it as
sudo bash /home/ec2-user/ramaddainstaller/update.sh

/mnt/ramadda/runtime - The installed server
/mnt/ramadda/runtime/ramadda.log - The log output of the server
/mnt/ramadda/runtime/ramaddaserver - The ramadda executable
The service runs
/mnt/ramadda/runtime/ramaddaserver/ramadda.sh 

/mnt/ramadda/repository - The RAMADDA home directory. 
/mnt/ramadda/repository/install.properties - Holds the database password
/mnt/ramadda/repository/keystore - The generated keystore. Replace this with a real certificate
/mnt/ramadda/repository/ssl.properties - Holds the keystore passwords
/mnt/ramadda/repository/install.properties - Holds the configuration password
/mnt/ramadda/repository/db.properties - Holds the database password
/mnt/ramadda/pgsql - Postgres database
</pre>
