[ht::head {Sort Order} ]

:navtop

There are two main ways to define the sort order  entries are displayed - using the Sort Order metadata property
or explicitly in a wiki tag.
Both of these ways can specify one or more entry fields to sort on and a sort direction - ascending or descending.

:heading Sort fields
The different entry sort fields are:
* name - The entry name
* fromdate, todate, createdate,changedate
* entryorder - All entries have an integer entry order. See <a href=#entryorder>below</a>
* folder - This sorts "folder" like entries first
* type  - The entry type name
* size - File size
* number - this extracts the first numeric value in the entry name


:heading Sort Order Property
There is a special Sort order metadata property that can be added to any entry.
* Go to the "Add Properties" entry menu
* Look for "Sort Order"
* Specify the desired sort field and direction

+callout-info
Note: you can configure a sort order for an entire tree of entries by checking on "Inherited".
To define the default sort order for the entire repository add a Sort Order property
to the top-level entry and check on "Inherited".
-callout

The "Or:" field in the above form allows you to define one or more  comma separated sort fields, e.g.:
the below would show all folders first, then sort by number then by name.
+pre
folder,number,name
-pre

You can add a "_up" or a "_down" suffix to the sort field to specify the sort order, e.g.:
+pre
folder_down,number_up,name
-pre


:heading Sorting with Wiki Text
The default display of any entry can be overwritten with
wiki text. Using this one can specify a sort order and other display components if desired.
When editing the container entry (e.g., the entry that holds images)
toggle on the <img width=16px src="{{root}}/icons/wiki.png"> checkbox. This enables the wiki text editor.
See <a href=wiki.html#wikidesc>here</a> for more details.
:p
Once wiki text is enabled you can add the following wiki text if you wanted to set the
sort order for a photo gallery:
+pre addCopy=true
+section title={{name}}
{{gallery  orderby="entryorder" ascending=true }} 
-section
-pre

This displays the children entries in a photo gallery and explicitly defines the sort order to
be based on the entry order.
:p
In general all of the "collection" tags, e.g. gallery, tabletree, map, links, tabs, etc can
have their sort order set.



:heading Examples

:heading2 Sort  by Date
For example, say you have a collection of images that are contained by a Photo Album entry.
By default the Photo Album sorts its entries by date. So, one way to do this is to explicitly
set the date on each Image entry.

:heading2 Sort by Name 
If you wanted to sort by name you can add a special "Sort Order" property to the Photo Album.
* Go to the "Add Properties" entry menu
* Look for "Sort Order"
* Specify Name for the Field and Ascending=true



<a name=entryorder></a>
:heading2 Entry Order
If you want to have an explicit sort order other than using date or name you can use
the Entry Order field. All entries have a numeric entry order field.
To set the entry order go to the Information page of the Photo Album.
The Information page shows a list of the entries. The Order field is editable. Simply change
the entry order - e.g. 1-999. Make sure you hit return in each field (The field will highlight in
yellow when you hit return.

You can click on the "Order" table header to sort on order to see the updated order:

Once you have the entry order set to the desired order go add (or edit) the Sort Order property
as described above and set the field to be "Entry Order"
