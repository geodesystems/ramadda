:heading Sort  by Date
There are a number of ways to change the sort order of how entries are displayed.
For example, say you have a collection of images that are contained by a Photo Album entry.
By default the Photo Album sorts its entries by date. So, one way to do this is to explicitly
set the date on each Image entry.

:heading Sort by Name 
If you wanted to sort by name you can add a special "Sort Order" property to the Photo Album.
* Go to the "Add Properties" entry menu
* Look for "Sort Order"
* Specify Name for the Field and Ascending=true

:heading Entry Order
If you want to have an explicit sort order other than using date or name you can use
the Entry Order field. All entries have a numeric entry order field.
To set the entry order go to the Information page of the Photo Album.
The Information page shows a list of the entries. The Order field is editable. Simply change
the entry order - e.g. 1-999. Make sure you hit return in each field (The field will highlight in
yellow when you hit return.

You can click on the "Order" table header to sort on order to see the updated order:

Once you have the entry order set to the desired order go add (or edit) the Sort Order property
as described above and set the field to be "Entry Order"

:heading With Wiki Text
The default display of any entry can be overwritten with
wiki text. Using this one can specify a sort order and other display components if desired.
When editing the container entry (e.g., the entry that holds images)
toggle on the <img width=16px src="{{root}}/icons/wiki.png"> checkbox. This enables the wiki text editor.
See <a href=wiki.html#wikidesc>here</a> for more details.
:p
Once wiki text is enabled you can add the following wiki text if you wanted to set the
sort order for a photo gallery:
+pre addCopy=true
+section title={{name}}
{{gallery  orderby="entryorder" ascending=true }} 
-section
-pre

This displays the children entries in a photo gallery and explicitly defines the sort order to
be based on the entry order.
:p
In general all of the "collection" tags, e.g. gallery, tabletree, map, links, tabs, etc can
have their sort order set.
