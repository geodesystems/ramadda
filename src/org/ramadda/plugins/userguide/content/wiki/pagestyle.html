:heading Creating Page Styles

Go to the [ht::menu Edit {Add Property}] menu and
under "Thumbnails, Page Style, Etc." select Page Style.
The Page Style property allows you to specify what menus to show, whether to show other features and
you can also specify a wiki text template to use for the default HTML views of the entries:

+callout-info
In the Page Style you can specify whether the style is appicable to the
current entry with "Apply to entry" and/or specify the entry type
to which the style is applicable to. 
:p
If you want this Page Style to be appicable to a whole sub-tree of RAMADDA entries
check on the "Inherited" flag for the property.

<ul> 
<li> Menus.
To control if the menu bar is shown and what menus get shown enter either "none" in
the menus field (to not show the menu bar) or a comma separated list of the
menus you do want to show:<pre>
file
edit
feeds
view 
other
</pre>

+callout-info
Note: Just so you don't lose the ability to
edit the entry the menu bar is always shown for users who have edit privileges for the
entry being displayed.
-callout-info

<li> Breadcrumbs: This is the breadcrumb trail of the ancestors of an entry.
<li> Show Toolbar: This is the icon toolbar (e.g., edit, delete, copy, etc)
<li> Show Entry Header: The Entry icon, name and Layout: icons


<li> Wiki Template: If defined this is the Wiki template used for the default HTML
display of the entry. See [ug::link wiki.html wiki.html] for information on
the wiki facility.
</ul>


:heading Example
For example, if you wanted to override the default display of a certain entry type
(e.g., Seabird CNV files) for the entire repository then do-
<ul>
  <li> Add a Page Style property to the top-level entry
  <li> Check off the "Apply to this entry" box
  <li> Under Entry Type specify "type_point_ocean_cnv". This can
    be found by viewing the Information page for one of the entries.
  <li> Add the wiki text.
  <li> If you want to use the default wiki text for the entry you can access it
    through the Embed Entry menu as described <a href=wiki.html#embedding_wiki_text>here</a>
  <li> Check on the "Inherited" box
  <li> Save the Page Style and you should now see the changes for any of the entries of the specified type.
</ul>
