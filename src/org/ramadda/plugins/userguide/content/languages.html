:heading Phrase Files
Language translations are defined in a set of language pack phrase files.
These files are installed as RAMADDA plugins and should be called:
+pre
&lt;language id&gt;.pack
or
&lt;language id&gt;.pack.txt
-pre
Where &lt;language id&gt; is the short identifier for the language, e.g. 

There are a number of pre-defined language phrase files. 
You can view these files on
<a href=https://github.com/geodesystems/ramadda/tree/master/src/org/ramadda/repository/htdocs/languages>Github</a>.
:p
You can view the list of available languages and their phrase translations 
<a href="{{root}}/languages">here</a>.


:heading Language Switcher
To enable the display of the page language widget 
<i class="fas fa-language ramadda-header-icon"></i>
in the upper right of every page set the following property in
a repository.properties file or in the Admin-&gt;Settings Properties section
+pre addCopy=true
ramadda.languages.enabled = true
-pre


To show a large language switcher add the wiki text:
+pre
<x>:langswitcher en,es,fr
-pre

e.g.:
+center
:langswitcher en,es,fr
-center
  
If you want to add the language switcher to every page 
add the above langswitcher wiki text to a <a  href=pageconfig.html>Page Header</a>
property.


  

:heading Setting the Language
To set the language on a page add the following wiki text:
+pre
<x>:setlang &lt;the language ID&gt;
-pre

e.g. for Spanish:
+pre
<x>:setlang es
-pre

:heading Adding new phrases
You can add to the set of translations to your RAMADDA with a 
"Language Phrases File" property file added to any entry.
This enables you to add new phrases and/or overwrite the existing translation.
:p
Add this property to the top-level entry and set its inherited flag to true
and these phrases can be used  throughout your RAMADDA entries.
:p
This file is of the form:
+pre
English phrase=&lt;translation&gt;
Another English phrase=&lt;translation&gt;  
...
-pre

Upload the file and set its language to the appropriate ID, e.g. "es", "fr", "lkt", etc.
  


:heading Language Blocks
The wiki text of an entry can have any number of language blocks.  This lets you have long form
text for different languages.
+pre
<x>+lang en
This is the English
<x>-lang  
<x>+lang es
This is the Spanish
<x>-lang  
-pre

e.g.:
+lang en
This is the English
-lang  
+lang es
This is the Spanish
-lang  

:heading Defining new languages
To define a new language, e.g, with ID "es" download the set of phrases  from:
<a href="https://ramadda.org/languages/base.pack.txt">
https://ramadda.org/languages/base.pack.txt
</a>
:p
Change the name to use the language identifier and copy the file into the plugins directory
under your RAMADDA home directory, e.g.
+pre
es.pack.txt
-pre

You will then need to edit the file. Change the type and name to the appropriate values:
+pre
language.type=es
language.name=Espa√±ol
-pre

Then, for every phrase provide a translation, e. g.:
+pre
Date = Fecha
-pre
