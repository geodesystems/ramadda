RAMADDA has support for multiple languages
-callout

:heading Phrase Files
Language translations are defined in a set of language pack phrase files.
These files are installed as RAMADDA plugins and should be called:
+pre
&lt;language id&gt;.pack.txt
-pre
Where &lt;language id&gt; is the short identifier for the language, e.g. "es.pack.txt".
:p
There are a number of pre-defined language phrase files. 
You can view these files on
<a href=https://github.com/geodesystems/ramadda/tree/master/src/org/ramadda/repository/htdocs/languages>Github</a>.
:p
You can view an interactive page showing the available languages and their phrase translations 
<a href="{{root}}/languages">here</a>.



:heading Language Switcher
To enable the display of the page language widget 
<i class="fas fa-language ramadda-header-icon"></i>
in the upper right of every page set the following property in
a repository.properties file or in the Admin-&gt;Settings Properties section
+pre addCopy=true
ramadda.languages.enabled = true
-pre


To show a large language switcher add the wiki text:
+pre
<x>:langswitcher en,es,fr
-pre

e.g.:
+center
:langswitcher en,es,fr
-center
  
If you want to add the language switcher to every page 
add the above langswitcher wiki text to a <a  href=pageconfig.html>Page Header</a>
property.


  

:heading Language Blocks
The wiki text of an entry can have any number of language blocks.  This lets you have long form
text for different languages.
+pre
<x>+lang en
This is the English
<x>-lang  
<x>+lang es
This is the Spanish
<x>-lang  
-pre

e.g.:
+lang en
This is the English
-lang  
+lang es
This is the Spanish
-lang  

You can also define or overwrite a translation for a particular phrase on a page with:
+pre
<x>:phrase ID "English phrase" "Translation"
e.g.:
<x>:phrase es "Language Blocks" "Some Spanish translation for Language Blocks"
-pre
:phrase es "Language Blocks" "Some Spanish translation for Language Blocks"



:heading Setting the Language
To set the language on a page add the following wiki text:
+pre
<x>:setlang &lt;the language ID&gt;
-pre

e.g. for Spanish:
+pre
<x>:setlang es
-pre


:heading Adding new phrases
You can add to the set of translations in your RAMADDA with a 
"Language Phrases File" property file added to any entry.
This enables you to add new phrases and/or overwrite the existing translation.
:p
This file is of the form:
+pre
English phrase=&lt;translation&gt;
Another English phrase=&lt;translation&gt;  
...
-pre


Go to Add Properties of your top-level entry and look for the Add Language Phrases File
[ht::screenshot images/addlang1.png]

Then specify the language ID (e.g., "lkt") and upload your phrases file.
Setting the inherited flag to true will enable these phrases to be used  throughout your entires RAMADDA.

:p
And here are the available languages:
* \[https://ramadda.org/repository/languages/es.pack.txt  Spanish\]
* \[https://ramadda.org/repository/languages/fr.pack.txt French\]
* \[https://ramadda.org/repository/languages/lkt.pack.txt Lakota (Note this is a placeholder for now)\]


:heading Defining new languages
To define a new language, e.g, with ID "foo" download the base set of phrases  from:
\[https://ramadda.org/languages/base.pack.txt https://ramadda.org/languages/base.pack.txt\]
:p
Change the name to use the language identifier and copy the file into the plugins directory
under your RAMADDA home directory, e.g.
+pre
foo.pack.txt
-pre

You will then need to edit the file. Change the type and name to the appropriate values:
+pre
language.type=foo
language.name=Foo Language
-pre

Then, for every phrase provide a translation, e.g.:
+pre
Date=Fecha
-pre
