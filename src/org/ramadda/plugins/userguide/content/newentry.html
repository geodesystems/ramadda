[ht::head {Creating Folders and Entries}]

<%nochildlist%>

When you are logged in and you have the access to create a new folder or
entry under the folder that you are viewing there will be a set of links under the File section of the popup menu <img src="images/menu_arrow.gif">.


[ht::cimg images/filemenu.png {}  {border=0}]


If you just want to make a simple Folder or upload a File then choose the &quot;New Folder&quot; or &quot;New File&quot; menu item.


<p>

Selecting the &quot;Create a folder&quot; link will take you to the
create folder form:

[ht::cimg images/newfolder.png {} {border=0 width=600}]

Enter a name and an optional description, date range and lat/lon bounding box.


<subhead intoc="false" id="createentry">Uploading Files</subhead>
To upload a file to a RAMADDA repository you create a new Entry.
From the File menu select  &quot;New File&quot;.


The Create Entry form allows you to upload a file or specify a URL.
If you are a site administrator you can also specify a path to
a file on the server machine.

[ht::cimg images/newfile.png {} {border=0 width=600}]

The minimal you need to enter here is the file or URL. The other fields
are optional. If you do not enter a name then the file name is used.
<p>
If you have a number of files that you want to upload you can make a .zip file
of them on your machine and check on the &quot; Unzip Archive&quot; button.
<p>
If you are uploading a netcdf file (or another data type that can be opened,
e.g., grib, radar, area file, etc) checking &quot;Add Properties&quot;
will have RAMADDA crack open the file and harvest the time range, lat/lon
bounding box, global attributes and variables and add them as a property of
this Entry.
See the section on <a href="editing.html#autometadata">properties</a>  for more information.

<p>
The &quot;Data Type&quot; is an optional and arbitrary data type  that can 
be used to search for entries of this type.
<p>
The &quot;Date Pattern&quot; can be used to match on the file name to automatically 
figure out the date of this entry. 


<subhead intoc="false" id="newentry">Creating other kinds of entries</subhead>


RAMADDA offers a number of different entry types that can also be created. 
Choosing &quot;New Entry&quot; menu link takes you to a rather daunting page that lists all of the available entry types.

[ht::cimg images/entrylist.png {}  {border=0}]

Fear not though, once you select an entry type then there will be a short-cut in the File menu.
