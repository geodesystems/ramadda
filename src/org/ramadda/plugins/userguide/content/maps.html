:heading Adding custom map layers
Additional map layers can be added to a RAMADDA install.
Any plugin file (in your &lt;RAMADDA home dir&gt;/plugins directory) that ends with
"mapextra.js" will be included in a bundled JS file. For example you can see the custom map layers on ramadda.org at <a href=https://ramadda.org/repository/map/extra/extra.js>https://ramadda.org/repository/map/extra/extra.js</a>.
