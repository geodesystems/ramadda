:heading Adding custom map layers
Additional map layers can be added to a RAMADDA install.
Any plugin file (in your &lt;RAMADDA home dir&gt;/plugins directory) that ends with
"mapextra.js" will be included in a bundled JS file. For example you can see the custom map layers on ramadda.org at <a href=https://ramadda.org/repository/map/extra/extra.js>https://ramadda.org/repository/map/extra/extra.js</a>.

Here is a basic example of adding custom WMS and WMTS layers:

<a href=examples/mapextra.js.example>mapextra.js.example</a>

Change the name of the file to mapextra.js

And here is an example of adding  weather WMTS layers. This includes GOES satellite images, NWS radar and precipitation layers:

<a href=examples/wxmapextra.js.example>wxmapextra.js.example</a>

Change the name of the file to wxmapextra.js
