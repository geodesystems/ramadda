RAMADDA provides an Integrated Map Data Viewer (IMDV) entry type that supports the creation
of rich interactive maps.
There are lots of examples on <a href=https://ramadda.org/repository/a/imdv>ramadda.org</a>.

:br
:heading Create a New Map

From the entry menu choose "Pick a Type...". Under GIS Data select "Integrated Map Data":

[ht::cimg images/imdv/new.png {New Entry}]

Enter a name for your map. You can ignore the file. Enter some description.
Note: the description is wiki text.

Once created you will have the initial display below. The File menu allows you to save
changes to your map. The Edit menu 

[ht::screenshot images/imdv/imdv1.png {Initial Display}]

:br
:heading Basic Editing

Select the New menu to see the different map glyph types that can be added. 
There are basic shapes - Marker, Label, Lines, Box, etc. 
[ht::screenshot images/imdv/newmenu.png {New Menu}]

Selecting a shape click and/or click-drag in the map to create the shape.
Once something is created in the map a legend is shown on the left.

Clicking on the toggle arrow (<i class="fas fa-caret-down" style=""></i>)
shows more details for the glyph. The <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> link
takes brings up an edit window for that glyph. This allows you to specify
the drawing style and other properties.

The Edit Menu allows you to select glyphs, cut/copy/paste, etc.

:heading Adding a Map
The IMDV supports adding a number of map files - GeoJson, GPX and Shapefile.
First upload the file to RAMADDA as a regular file entry.
Then from the IMDV New menu, select "Map". The Map Entry selector will be shown:
Navigated through your RAMADDA entry hierarchy and select the map file.
[ht::screenshot images/imdv/newmap.png]

Once added the IMDV will zoom to the map area. If there are properties defined in your map file
then a Filters area  will shown. These allow you to toggle on/off the map features. You can save
this state (through the File/Save menu).

Editing this map glyph (with the <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> link) allows you
to define a set of style rules based on the feature properties.
If there is numeric features you can specify a color table to provide fill color for the features.
Here we've defined a set of styles for the OWN_TYPE_NAME property-

:br
:heading Adding an Image
You can add a georeferenced image to your IMDV.
There are 4 ways to initiate adding an image:
* Drag and drop an image file onto the map. You will be prompted for the new image entry name and the image file will be added as a child entry of the imdv map
* Paste and image from the clipboard. This will behave like drag-and-drop.
* Upload an image to RAMADDA beforehand. Select New-&gt;Image from the IMDV menu and select the image entry
* Select New-&gt;Image from the IMDV menu and enter the URL to the image
Once an image is selected you drag an area on the map. 
:p
Here we're going to add in a aerial photo taken in 1937 of the Boulder Colorado area.
First upload the image to RAMADDA. Then in the IMDV navigate to the area of interest.
Then do New-&gt;Image and choose the  image:
[ht::screenshot images/imdv/newimage.png]

Click and drag out a region. The IMDV will maintain the aspect ratio of the image.
Pressing the shift key while dragging will set the image region to the drag rectangle.
Once added you can change the opacity of the image with the Image Opacity slider or from the
image edit settings. This allows you to see what is underneath the image. From
the Edit menu choose Reshape and click on the image. This lets you change the area and shape
of the image. Note: not all imagery will be in the projection of the underlying map so
georeferencing  the image can be inexact.

:br
:heading Adding a Route
If your RAMADDA is <a href=/repository/userguide/keys.html#otherapis>enabled</a>
then a Route glyph type will be shown in the New menu.
Select the desired provider (here.com or google) and the route type:
[ht::screenshot images/imdv/newroute.png]

Click and draw a multi-segment line. Double clicking to end.
The route will be shown. The legend shows the calculated distance:

:br
:heading Entry Markers 
The Entry Marker and the Multi Entry allow you to add markers
for RAMADDA entries. Clicking on the marker will show some content
from that entry.
For example, RAMADDA supports 3D Models as an entry type. 
Choosing New-&gt;Entry Marker and adding it to the map will add a marker. Clicking on that marker
will show a 3D view of the model:
[ht::screenshot images/imdv/entrymarker.png]


The Multi Entry allows you to select some Folder in RAMADDA. All of the geolocated children entries
in that folder will be shown in the map. For example, if you had a Folder of a number of map files
add the folder as a Multi Entry. This adds markers for each map file. Clicking on a marker shows
the view of the entry (like above). In the legend clicking on the <i class="fas fa-plus"></i> link
will add that entry as a map into the main map.

:br
:heading Adding Data Displays
RAMADDA provides very rich capabilities to show data in maps, e.g.
on <a href=https://ramadda.org/repository/a/maps>ramadda.org</a>.
These displays are accomplished through RAMADDA's <a href=wiki.html>wiki</a>
facility. You can import one or more map data  displays into an IMDV.
:p
First, upload your data to RAMADDA and create a map display for that data
using RAMADDA's <a href=wiki.html>wiki</a> facility.
Next, from the IMDV New menu select Data and select the data you uploaded.
The IMDV will extract from you data's wiki the arguments for a map display.
These will be shown and can be edited if needed. Here we've selected some aircraft
track data:
[ht::screenshot images/imdv/newdata.png]

With the result map:
[ht::screenshot images/imdv/data1.png]

The map display properties can be edited through the Edit form.
Other  data displays can be added and overlaid on the IMDV map.
:p
You can play around with this by importing the file 
<a href=Showing_data_in_maps.zip>Showing_data_in_maps.zip</a>
to your RAMADDA. This is an export of the example showing Colorado aircraft crashes and
Colorado mines on
<a href=https://ramadda.org/repository/entry/show?entryid=a4ba9818-b8ed-4512-9cfb-f81d6e44acba>
