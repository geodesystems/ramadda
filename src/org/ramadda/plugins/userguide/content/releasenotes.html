<h2>Installing and Upgrading</h2>

<div class="boxquote">
Note: Many users ask if upgrading RAMADDA will effect any existing content. All of the content and files are kept in the RAMADDA home directory and in the database. As long as those directories remain untouched there should not be any problem in upgrading. However, you will need to update any plugins you have installed in the RAMADDA plugins directory. 
</div>


To update an existing RAMADDA install:

<ul>

<li> Update plugins
<ul>
<li> As noted above there are now 3 plugin collections - core, geo and bio. If you have the old allplugins.jar installed then RAMADDA will update appropriately. 

<li> If you have individual  plugins installed then you should update them to the latest 
<a href="http://geodesystems.com/repository/alias/release/">versions</a>.

</ul>



<li> If you are running stand-alone then download and unzip the ramaddaserver.zip from the
<a href="http://geodesystems.com/repository/alias/release">Geode Systems</a> site.


<li> If you are running under Tomcat or Glassfish then download and install the repository.war
