:heading Integration with OpenAI GPT
RAMADDA uses OpenAI's GPT API for extracting keywords and text summaries for documents
(PDF, Word, etc). To enable this you will need to register with
<a href=https://openai.com/api/>OpenAI</a> and obtain an API key. They provide a free tier.
:p
Once you obtain the API key add it to a .properties file in your RAMADDA home directory:

+pre
gpt.api.key=&lt;your key&gt;
-pre

:heading Summary and Keyword Extraction

Now, when you go to add a document entry to RAMADDA under the "More..." section select
Extract keywords and/or Extract Summary. Any keywords extracted will be added as metadata
and the summary will be pre-prended to the new entry's description.

:heading Wiki Editor
The Wiki editor provides an interface to the GPT api. If GPT is enabled there
will be a GPT link Under the Etc... menu. This brings up the below dialog. Any text
that is selected in the wiki editor will be added to the input area. When Evaluated the
prompts and the input text are sent to GPT and the result is placed in the Results area.
You can then either replace the selected text with the results or append the results.
