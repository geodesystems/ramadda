:heading Integration with OpenAI GPT
RAMADDA uses OpenAI's GPT API for extracting keywords and text summaries for documents
(PDF, Word, etc). To enable this you will need to register with
<a href=https://openai.com/api/>OpenAI</a> and obtain an API key. They provide a free tier.
:p
Once you obtain the API key add it to a .properties file in your RAMADDA home directory:

+pre
gpt.api.key=&lt;your key&gt;
-pre

Now, when you go to add a document entry to RAMADDA under the "More..." section select
Extract keywords and/or Extract Summary. Any keywords extracted will be added as metadata
and the summary will be pre-prended to the new entry's description.
