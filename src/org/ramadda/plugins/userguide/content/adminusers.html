<subhead  id="newuser"  intoc="false">Creating New Users</subhead>
From the Admin-&gt;Users tab select the &quot;New User&quot; button. This takes you to a page where you can create
an indivdual user account or do a bulk create.
<p>

When creating a user specify a user id, their name, whether they are an administrator, their email address and an initial password.
Note: if a user is created as an administrator then they will have full access to do anything on the RAMADDA server.

<p>
The Home Folder allows you to specify an existing  folder, under which a new folder with the user's name will be created. This folder will be owned by the user (so they can upload files, etc) and is added to the user's list of favorites. 
You cannot actually type in the field. Rather, press the <i>Select</i> link to popup a folder selector.

<p>
If you have configured RAMADDA with a SMTP mail server then you can also send mail to the new user, including instructions on how to change their password. Just select the &quot;Send an email to the new user with message&quot; checkbox.

<p>
In the &quot;Bulk User Create&quot; you can upload a comma separated list of users. Note: the above user home folder and email
settings are not applied to the bulk created user accounts.


<subhead  id="roles"  intoc="false">User Roles</subhead>
When creating or editing a user account you can specify any number of roles in the given text field (one per line).
The user roles mechanism is used to define access control for entries. See <a href="access.html">here</a> for  more information.
