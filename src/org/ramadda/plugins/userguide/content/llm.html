+callout-info
RAMADDA makes use of OpenAI's GPT API or Google's Gemini API
in a number of ways. Various metadata can be extracted from
documents and the wiki editor can make use of the LLMs to convert and create text.

:heading Integration with Google's Gemini Model
Get an API key from <a href=https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard>Anthropic</a> and
set the property:
+pre addCopy=true
claude.api.key=your key
-pre


:heading Integration with Anthropic's Claude Model
Get an API key from <a href=https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/ai-studio_quickstart>Google</a> and
set the property:
+pre addCopy=true
gemini.api.key=your key
-pre


:heading Integration with OpenAI GPT
RAMADDA uses OpenAI's GPT API for extracting keywords and text summaries for documents
(PDF, Word, etc). To enable this you will need to register with
<a href=https://openai.com/api/>OpenAI</a> and obtain an API key. They provide a free tier.
:p
Once you obtain the API key add it to a
<a href="installing.html#properties">.properties file</a> 
in your RAMADDA home directory:

+pre addCopy=true
openai.api.key=&lt;your key&gt;
#To enable GPT4 (which comes with a higher cost) set:
openai.gpt4.enabled=true
-pre

:heading Cost
RAMADDA uses the <a href="https://openai.com/pricing">gpt-3.5-turbo</a> which costs $0.002 / 1K tokens. Each of the document extraction actions described below (title, author, summary, keywords)
require one call and approximately 3K - 4K tokens are passed to OpenAI. So, each call is
approximately 1/2 to 1 cent per call.


:heading Summary and Keyword Extraction

Now, when you go to add a document entry to RAMADDA under the "More..." section select
Extract keywords and/or Extract Summary. Any keywords extracted will be added as metadata
and the summary will be pre-prended to the new entry's description.

:heading Wiki Editor
The Wiki editor provides an interface to the GPT api. If GPT is enabled there
will be a GPT link Under the Etc... menu. This brings up the below dialog. Any text
that is selected in the wiki editor will be added to the input area. When Evaluated the
prompts and the input text are sent to GPT and the result is placed in the Results area.
You can then either replace the selected text with the results or append the results.

:heading Audio to Text Transcriptions
Also under the Etc... menu is a Transcription service. You can record audio
through your browser and then the audio is sent to OpenAI's Whisper API for
transcription to text.
:p
Note: this does not appear to work with Safari as the .mp4 audio file format Safari
creates is not accepted by OpenAI.
