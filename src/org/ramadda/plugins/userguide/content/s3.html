<subhead intoc="false" id="configuration">Configuring your RAMADDA</subhead>
RAMADDA uses the AWS CLI. Once you have installed it on your machine
define a property in <i>repository.properties</i> in your RAMADDA home directory:
<pre>
ramadda.aws.path=/path/to/aws
e.g.:
ramadda.aws.path=/usr/local/bin/aws
</pre>

For now, RAMADDA uses the --no-sign-request  argument to AWS so it does not
require any credentials configuration.

<subhead intoc="false" id="s3_harvesting">S3 Harvesting</subhead>
The RAMADDA file <a href="harversters.html">harvester</a>
can also harvest a S3 bucket store.

<subhead intoc="false" id="s3_entry">S3 Bucket Entry</subhead>
A S3 Bucket entry type is provided. This allows you to have a "synthetic" set of entries
in RAMADDA that represent the S3 bucket hierarchy. These entries do not exist
in the RAMADDA database but can be viewed and accessed through the web interface.

<subhead intoc="false" id="s3_cli">S3 Tools</subhead>
As a convenience RAMADDA provides a S3 command line utility in the <a href="seesv.html">SeeSV</a>
package.
:p
Download and unzip the <href="https://ramadda.org/repository/entry/show?entryid=synth:498644e1-20e4-426a-838b-65cffe8bd66f:L3NlZXN2LnppcA==">seesv.zip</a> and run the s3.sh to get a help listing:
<pre>
sh s3.sh -help
Usage:
S3File 
	&lt;-download  download the files&gt;  
	&lt;-makedirs make a tree when downloading files&gt; 
	&lt;-overwrite overwrite the files when downloading&gt; 
	&lt;-sizelimit size mb (don't download files larger than limit (mb)&gt; 
	&lt;-percent 0-1  (for buckets with many (&gt;100) siblings apply this as percent probablity that the bucket will be downloaded)&gt; 
	&lt;-recurse  recurse down the tree when listing&gt; 
	&lt;-self print out the details about the bucket&gt; ... one or more buckets
</pre>  

Another utility is provided in the RAMADDA repository runtime at the
/aws/s3/list entry point. This provides an interface to the above tool
to do a recursive listing of a bucket store.
Check it out on <a href="https://ramadda.org/repository/aws/s3/list">
