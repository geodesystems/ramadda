<h2>Installing on Amazon AWS and Linux</h2>

+callout-info
Here are the steps to install the stand-alone version of RAMADDA on Amazon Linux, Redhat,
Ubuntu or Centos.
-callout

If you are running on Amazon AWS see <a href=awsec2.html>awsec2.html</a> for details on how to create a server.


:heading Configure your instance
Once your instance is running here are the steps to configure and install RAMADDA.
<ol>
  <li> If you are running on AWS then, from the Instances page,
    view the details of your instance to see its IPv4 Public IP

<li> SSH to your instance using the PEM file:
<pre>
ssh -i &lt;.pem file&gt;  ec2-user@&lt;server IP address&gt;
</pre>


<li> It is best to update the instance:
<pre>
For Amazon Linux:
sudo yum update -y

For Ubuntu:
sudo apt update

You also may need to install unzip:
For Amazon:
sudo yum install unzip

For Ubuntu:
sudo apt install unzip
</pre>


<li> Fetch and unzip the RAMADDA installer:
+pre addCopy=true
wget https://ramadda.org/repository/release/latest/ramaddainstaller.zip;unzip ramaddainstaller.zip
-pre

<li> Run the installer: 
+pre addCopy=true
sudo sh ramaddainstaller/install.sh
-pre
</ol>

The installer will walk you through a number of installation steps to setup the directories, and install and configure
Java, Postgres (optionally)  and the RAMADDA server.
The installer will:
<ul>
<li> Let you choose where the ramaddainstaller and ramaddahome directories will be placed

<li> If on AWS mount the EBS volume ias <i>/mnt/ramadda</i>

<li> For Amazon Linux you can optionally install and configure PostgreSQL.
  A RAMADDA user and a repository database will be created. The database will be stored at: 
  <i>/mnt/ramadda/pgsql</i> and which is linked to from <i>/var/lib/pgsql</i>.
  If you don't choose Postgres then RAMADDA defaults to it's built-in Derby database.

<li> Download and install RAMADDA. 

<li> Configure RAMADDA with a self-signed certificate for HTTPS access.
  Accessing this for the first time will result in a browser warning because it is self-signed.

<li> Install RAMADDA as a service.

</ul>

Once running you need to finish the configuration through the RAMADDA web interface:
<pre>
https://&lt;IP address&gt;/repository
</pre>
The install process will display an installation password that you enter through the web interface.
This install password is held in &gt;RAMADDA Home&gt;/install.properties
:br
Note: since the SSL certificate is self-signed your browser will display a warning when accessing the site.

:heading Server files

The install will result in:
<pre>
The installer:
&lt;home dir&gt;/ramaddainstaller  

Update script:
sudo sh &lt;home dir&gt;/ramaddainstaller/update.sh

The installed server:
/mnt/ramadda/ramaddainstall

A file that contains the RAMADDA_HOME, PORT and path to Java
It is sourced by the ramadda.sh below
/mnt/ramadda/ramaddainstall/ramaddaenv.sh

The log output of the server:
/mnt/ramadda/ramaddainstall/ramadda.log 

The ramadda executable:
/mnt/ramadda/ramaddainstall/ramaddaserver 

The service runs
/mnt/ramadda/ramaddainstall/ramaddaserver/ramadda.sh 

------------------------------
The RAMADDA home directory:
/mnt/ramadda/ramaddahome 

Holds the database password:
/mnt/ramadda/ramaddahome/install.properties 

The generated keystore. You can replace this with a real certificate
/mnt/ramadda/ramaddahome/keystore 

Holds the keystore passwords:
/mnt/ramadda/ramaddahome/ssl.properties

Holds the install password:
/mnt/ramadda/ramaddahome/install.properties 

Holds the database password:
/mnt/ramadda/ramaddahome/db.properties  


------------------------------
Postgres database (if installed): The /var/lib/... pgsql dir links to here
/mnt/ramadda/pgsql
