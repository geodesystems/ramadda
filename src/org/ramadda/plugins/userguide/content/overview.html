[ht::head {RAMADDA Overview}]


RAMADDA is organized around a hierarchical collection of entries. These may be 
Folders, Files or some other entry type. In RAMADDA you are always viewing some entry. Here is an example of a Folder entry page in RAMADDA. You can navigate the tree of the folder's children entries or directly go to the child entry page.

When you are viewing an entry the
<span><i class="fas fa-caret-down"></i></span>
link brings up the entry menu. 
This allows you to view the entry in different ways (e.g, map, table, timeline, etc.), create folders, upload files and edit the entry.

RAMADDA has a number of facilities that make it easier to copy, move and
manage the entries in the repository.
When you are viewing a Folder if you click on the arrow icon 
<span><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i></span>
the Entry List form will be shown. You can select entries, select an action
then apply the action. For example, you can delete a number of entries all in one go.

You can also shift-drag on an entry and drag and drop it onto another entry to
either move or copy.
