[ht::head {RAMADDA Overview}]


RAMADDA is organized around a hierarchical collection of entries. These may be 
Folders, Files or some other entry type. In RAMADDA you are always viewing some entry. Here is an example of a Folder entry page in RAMADDA. You can navigate the tree of the folder's children entries or directly go to the child entry page.

And here is an example of a file page:
[ht::cimg images/overview2.png {} {width=600}]


When you are viewing an entry the <img src="images/menu_arrow.gif"> button brings up a menu. This allows you to view the entry in different ways (e.g, map, table, timeline, etc.), create folders, upload files and edit the entry.
