[ht::head {Admin Maintenance}]

:navtop


The Admin-&gt;Maintenance section provides a number of services for server maintenance.
These services are normally not needed.


:heading Reindex Lucene Index
On a very rare occasion the internal search index needs to be rebuilt for the entire repository
usually due to an internal change of the entry metadata or to fix transient problems with the
search index.

:heading Caches
This section allows you to clear the internal memory caches. This is usually only used when
debugging problems in RAMADDA.

:heading Clear Passwords
This clears all of the user passwords and should only be used when the passwords have been exposed
or corrupted. As the note describes right after this is done then the passwords should be
reset through the Admin-&gt;Users interface.
