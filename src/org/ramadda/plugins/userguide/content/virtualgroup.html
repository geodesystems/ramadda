:heading Virtual Group Entry
The Virtual Group entry type can have a list of other entries and/or search criteria.
For example, on the Examples page on ramadda.org this entry type is used to list
the <a href=https://ramadda.org/repository/entry/show?entryid=a86d071a-f098-4354-839f-1f58e2656854>latest examples </a>.
:p
When editing a Virtual Group there is a list of Entry IDs. This can hold individual entry IDs
or it can have a set of search specifications. For example, below we are searching
under two entries for the children of the entries, sorting the list of entries and only
using the first 42 entries. The entries with IDs some_entry_id and some_other_entry_id
are being excluded.
