[ht::head {Installing on Amazon AWS}]

<subhead intoc="false" id="installer">Installing on Amazon AWS</subhead>
Here are the steps to install the stand-alone version of RAMADDA on an AWS instance. 


The  installer <a href="${root}/userguide/examples/README.INSTALLER">README</a> describes 
the set of steps required to launch and configure an instance through the
<a href="https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home">Amazon EC2 Dashboard</a>,
and how to download and run the RAMADDA installer on that instance.
<p>
An alternative  is to use the command line installation script described below.


<subhead intoc="false" id="createinstance">Create an EC2 Instance</subhead>
<ol>
<li> From the EC2 Dashboard go to the  Instances page and select  "Launch Instance".

<li> Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)<br>
Pick a standard Amazon Linux 2 AMI image. Note: RAMADDA can run on REDHAT Linux but the installer
has not been fully tested.

<li> Choose an Instance Type<br>
The instance type depends on your expected load. For example 
<a href="https://ramadda.org">https://ramadda.org</a> runs on a t2.medium but a 
t2.micro or t2.small works just fine.

<li> Configure Instance Details<br>
The defaults may be OK but you may want to  create a new network and  subnet.

<li>Add Storage<br>
The instance comes with a smallish volume where /home is mounted. 
You should add a new volume. 
This is where RAMADDA's home directory, uploaded files and database will be stored. The size depends on the expected size of your RAMADDA use.
For example, for the <a href="https://ramadda.org">https://ramadda.org</a> 
repository (which has a ton of content) the database size is ~4GB and the files take up ~20GB.



<li> Configure Security Group<br>
Create a security group with the following ports:
<pre>
SSH  port 22
HTTP port 80 - Source should be the default <i>0.0.0.0/0, ::/0</i>
HTTPS port 443 - Source should be the default <i>0.0.0.0/0, ::/0</i>
</pre>



<li> Review Instance Launch<br>
Create (or select an existing) key pair file (e.g., ramadda.pem) and download it. 
Once downloaded, you will need to change permissions on your pem file, e.g.
<pre>
chmod 600 ramadda.pem
</pre>
   
</ol>



<subhead intoc="false" id="amazon">Create an EC2 Instance</subhead>

<li>  Configure your server
<pre>
#SSH to the machine
ssh -i <.pem file>  ec2-user@<server IP address>

##get the installer
wget -O ramaddainstaller.zip https://ramadda.org/repository/release/latest/ramaddainstaller.zip


#Unpack the installer
unzip ramaddainstaller.zip

#run the installer - make sure to give it the absolute path
sudo sh /home/ec2-user/ramaddainstaller/installer.sh
</pre>

This will walk you through a number of installation steps to setup the directories, and install and configure  Java, Postgres and RAMADDA

To start and stop RAMADDA do:
sudo sh ramaddainstaller/ramaddaserver/ramaddainit.sh stop|start|restart

</ol>

<subhead intoc="false" id="amazoncli">Command Line Amazon Install</subhead>
The installer also contains an <i>aws.sh</i> script.n
This script uses the 
<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html">Amazon Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>
to create and configure an Amazon machine instance running RAMADDA. In just a couple of minutes you can have a server up and running.

Consult the Amazon <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.html">CLI documentation</a>. 
You will need to set up an Amazon AWS account, create and download an access key file, and install the CLI runtime on your machine.
<p>
Once you have the CLI installed run the script:<pre>
  sh <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/ramadda/code/HEAD/tree/src/org/ramadda/repository/release/aws.sh">aws.sh</a>
</pre>


You can kill the script at any time and re-run it without messing things up though you might see some warnings along the way.

Right now, the script works best with the default instance type. Different instance types require running in a VPN and this all rather flummoxed the author.  More info about <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">instance types</a>
