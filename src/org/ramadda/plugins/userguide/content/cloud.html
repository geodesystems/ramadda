An early version of a RAMADDA installer is available that does a complete installation of Postgres and RAMADDA.
This runs on the  Amazon Linux Image but could (should) run on other Unix-es and in other cloud environments.


<subhead intoc="false" id="installer">RAMADDA Installer</subhead>

The  installer <a href="examples/README.INSTALLER">README</a> describes 
the set of steps required to launch and configure an instance through the
<a href="https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home">Amazon EC2 Dashboard</a>,
and how to download and run the RAMADDA installer on that instance.
<p>
An alternative  is to use the command line installation script described below.



<subhead intoc="false" id="amazon">Amazon EC2 Instances</subhead>


<ol>

<li> Create an Amazon AWS account. 

<li> From the EC2 Dashboard go to the  Instances page and select  Launch Instance
Choose the standard  Amazon Linux AMI and select the machine type

<li> Create a security group with the following ports:
<pre>
HTTP port 80
HTTPS port 443
SSH  port 22
Optionally open FTP: 
Custom TCP Rule port 21  
Custom TCP Rule port range 44001 - 44099
</pre>


<li>  Add a Storage Volume. <br>
Normally, the instance has a smallish volume. This is where /home is mounted. You can add an extra 
volume that holds the the database, the RAMADDA home directory and any data you may have. The size depends 
on how much data and content you plan to have on your RAMADDA. 100 GB is more than plenty for normal RAMADDA 
use. Note the device, e.g., /dev/sdb. This often will show up on the machine as /dev/xvdb. 

<li>  Download the PEM file<br>
When you Launch the instance create and save a .pem file. This is what you use to access your server.
The permissions on the pem file need to be 400, e.g.:
chmod 400 ramadda.pem

<li>  Configure your server
<pre>
#SSH to the machine
ssh -i <.pem file>  ec2-user@<server IP address>

##get the installer
wget "http://geodesystems.com/repository/entry/get/ramaddainstaller.zip?entryid=synth%3A498644e1-20e4-426a-838b-65cffe8bd66f%3AL3JhbWFkZGFfMi4xYi9yYW1hZGRhaW5zdGFsbGVyLnppcA%3D%3D"

#Unpack the installer
unzip ramaddainstaller.zip

#run the installer - make sure to give it the absolute path
sudo sh /home/ec2-user/ramaddainstaller/installer.sh
</pre>

This will walk you through a number of installation steps to setup the directories, and install and configure  Java, Postgres and RAMADDA

To start and stop RAMADDA do:
sudo sh ramaddainstaller/ramaddaserver/ramaddainit.sh stop|start|restart

</ol>

<subhead intoc="false" id="amazoncli">Command Line Amazon Install</subhead>
The installer also contains an <i>aws.sh</i> script.n
This script uses the 
<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html">Amazon Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>
to create and configure an Amazon machine instance running RAMADDA. In just a couple of minutes you can have a server up and running.

Consult the Amazon <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.html">CLI documentation</a>. 
You will need to set up an Amazon AWS account, create and download an access key file, and install the CLI runtime on your machine.
<p>
Once you have the CLI installed run the script:<pre>
  sh <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/ramadda/code/HEAD/tree/src/org/ramadda/repository/release/aws.sh">aws.sh</a>
</pre>


You can kill the script at any time and re-run it without messing things up though you might see some warnings along the way.

Right now, the script works best with the default instance type. Different instance types require running in a VPN and this all rather flummoxed the author.  More info about <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">instance types</a>
