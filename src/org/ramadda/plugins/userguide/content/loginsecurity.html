:heading User Login

The below properties are added to your repository.properties file when RAMADDA is initialized.
:p

To show the login/logout link in the header instead of in the cog menu popup set:
+pre addCopy=true
ramadda.showlogin=true
-pre

You can add text to the login form with:
+pre addCopy=true
#This is shown at the top of the login form
ramadda.user.preface=By logging in you agree to be cool and do good things

#This is shown as a checkbox when logging in
ramadda.user.agree=I have read and agree to the terms of use ...

-pre

:heading Google Recaptcha
Google Recaptcha can be used for verifying non-bot access to some services (below).
To enable Recaptcha you must obtain a sitekey and secret from google. See:
<a target=_other href=https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin>https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin</a>
:p
And set the following properties:
+pre addCopy=true
google.recaptcha.sitekey=
google.recaptcha.secret=
-pre


:heading Security
You can add an extra layer of security when doing admin tasks (e.g., changing passwords, adding users, etc).
This can prevent certain cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
Google Recaptcha can be used, if configured, and/or a password can be required.

+pre addCopy=true
#If Google recaptcha is enabled then set this to true
ramadda.auth.dorecaptcha=true
-pre

If you want to require a password for certain administrative tasks then set:
+pre addCopy=true
ramadda.auth.dopassword=true
-pre

:heading User Account Creation
RAMADDA can also be configured to allow users to self-register
The entry point to the user registration is at  https://&lt;server&gt;/repository/user/register
If Google Recaptcha is enabled then that is required when users create an account.
To enable users self-registration then set the below to true:

+pre addCopy=true
ramadda.register.ok=true
-pre

You can specify a pass phrase that has to be entered by the user to allow them to register

+pre addCopy=true
ramadda.register.passphrase=some_phrase
-pre

Specify a message and a checkbox:
+pre addCopy=true
ramadda.register.message=This is the message shown at the top of the registration form

#This is shown as a checkbox when registering
ramadda.register.agree=I agree to be cool and do good things
-pre


The default behavior is to set the new user to active.
If you want to set their status to pending and not allow them to login until the site Administrator
changes their status to active  set this to true:

+pre addCopy=true
ramadda.register.status.pending=true
-pre

Specify a comma separated list of emails to send a notification of new users registering
+pre addCopy=true
ramadda.register.notify=foo@bar.com
-pre
