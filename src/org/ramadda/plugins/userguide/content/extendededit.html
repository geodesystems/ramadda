There are a number of other edit capabilities under the Edit-&gt;Extended Edit menu. 



:heading Setting Metadata
For Folders you can recurse down the entry hierarchy and set the spatial and/or temporal bounds of each entry as the union of its children entry metadata.
When applied the set of entries that have been changed will be shown:

<a name="addalias"></a>
:heading Adding Aliases
Any entry can have one or more  aliases, e.g., "mydata". When an entry has an alias then it can be accessed via:
<pre>
https://yourramadda.org/repository/a/mydata
</pre>

An alias is a property and can be added with the entry menu-&gt;Add Alias:

Alternatively, you can go to entry menu-&gt;Add Property and select Add Alias under the
Thumbnails, Page Style, Etc., section:
[ht::screenshot images/addalias2.png]

If you have a number of entries that you want to add an alias for you can do that through the
Extended Edit page:

[ht::screenshot images/addalias3.png]

Scroll down to the "Add aliases for children entries" section and provide the template with the ${name} macro. The name will be a cleaned up version (lower case, no spaces, no special characters) of each entry name:
[ht::screenshot images/addalias4.png]

Initially no aliases will be added. Select the entries you want an alias for and press "Add aliases to selected entries".
If an entry already has an alias then no new alias will
be added. If an entry exists somewhere else that has the same alias then the alias won't be added.
You can always go and edit any of these aliases through the entry's Edit Properties section.

:heading Change Entry Type
The entry type of the entry you are editing can be changed.

Note: for entries that have special attributes (e.g., Project, Point Data) when you change the type to a different type the special attributes will be deleted.

:heading Change Descendents Entry Type
You can also recurse down the folder tree and change the type of all entries that match the specified original entry type
and/or a pattern that is matched on the name or the filename of the entry. Note: the pattern is a regular expression.

+callout-info
It is best to first see what entries would be changed. Then when satisfied
check on the "Yes, change them" checkbox.

So, for example, you might have a folder that contains a set of plain File entries that you want to change to be a certain data
type (e.g., Landsat Satellite Data). You would select "File" as the Old Type, Landsat Satellite data as the new type.
If you had a number of File entries but not all are to be changed you can use the pattern (e.g., ".*\.hdf")
to match on the File entries that you want to change.
 




:heading Change Descendents URL Path
You can recurse through the descendents and change the entries that have URLs.

:heading File Listing
The Generate File Listing will provide a summary of all of the files in the hierarchy. You 
can choose to only list entries that have a file that is missing or only list entries that are OK.

:heading Process with Javascript
This extended edit form allows you to specify some javascript that is called for each entry
down through the entry hierarchy. This enables you to do complex changes.

+callout-info
You need to check on the "Apply changes to entries" checkbox to have your changes actually applied.
