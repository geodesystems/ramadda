<h2>Mail Harvester</h2>

The email harvester allows you to harvest and ingest content from any IMAP enabled mail server.
This harvester acts as other harvesters. It is created by RAMADDA an administrator and can
be configured to run on a regular basis:
<p>

<p>
You first need to provide an IMAP URL of the form (assuming SSL IMAP):

<pre>
imaps://&lt;email address&gt;:&lt;email password&gt;@&lt;email server&gt;
</pre>

e.g.:
<pre>
imaps://sendtoramadda:password@imap.gmail.com
</pre>


Specify a mail Folder name (e.g., Inbox) and a set of criteria used to match
on the email that is to be ingested - sender, subject and body. These are just string patterns
that, if defined, are used to match on the mail.
<p>
Note: the harvester will only look at emails that have been marked as "unread". So, if you have mail that you want ingested
that has been read you will  need to mark those messages as unread.

<p>
A destination RAMADDA Folder needs to be specified. You can either have the harvester ingest
the mail message as a <i>.eml</i> file or it can create new RAMADDA entries from each attachment.
The name of the entry is derived from the mail subject and the attachment file name. 
If you specify:
<pre>
name: some name
</pre>
in the mail message then RAMADDA will use that as the entry name.

You can also specify the destination folder relative to the harvesters base folder with:
<pre>
at: some folder name
</pre>
So, for example, the base folder may contain sub-folders:<pre>
family
work
other
</pre>

If you send an email with:<pre>
some text
name: some name
at: family
some more text
</pre>

Then RAMADDA will add the entry to the family sub-folder and use "some name" as the name.


<p>
If no attachment is provided then RAMADDA will create a <i>note</i> entry type with the mail text body.
If the first line of the email is a valid URL then RAMADDA will create a <i>link</i> entry type.

<p>
If the Email Response 
is specified and if the RAMADDA server is configured to send email
then the original sender of the harvested email will be notified of the
new entries.


<h2>EML Files</h2>
RAMADDA can also ingest  <i>.eml </i> files as content. It will extract any attachments and add them as RAMADDA
attachments and also will extract mail metadata - from, to and date.
