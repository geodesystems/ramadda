Maybe you didn't believe me when I spoke of this karma and haircut issue. 
I really would appreciate your financial support.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
If you can't pay then don't worry, its cool. 
However, I ask that you give back to the community in some way. 
You could:
<ul>
<li> Join and be active on the RAMADDA mailing list 
<li> Help a colleague install and use RAMADDA
<li> Develop a new RAMADDA plugin for your data
<li> Write up a guest blog post describing how you use RAMADDA for your work
<li> etc.
</ul>
