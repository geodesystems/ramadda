<h1>What is FACTS?</h1>

<p>
Climate-related events require explanations that are both timely
and of scientific merit. Objective assessment of the nature and
causes of extreme events is scientifically challenging, and the
complexity of physical processes inevitably requires the use of
climate models to test and quantify cause-effect linkages.
</p>
<p>
One key factor to an objective assessment of weather/climate events
is data availability, both observational data and model simulations
that address the unique environment of a climate-related event under
consideration.

<p>
The <strong>FAC</strong>cility for Weather and Climate
Assessmen<strong>TS</strong> (FACTS) is a freely available resource
from NOAA/PSL that provides such datasets.  This site is
intended especially for the purpose of enabling near real-time
assessments of physical factors driving weather/climate events by
a broad scientific community and other interested users.
