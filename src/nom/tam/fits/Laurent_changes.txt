In BinaryTable:

 -- For ComplexData has bSize *= 2, size*=2.
    Not sure this is right.  Seems to be handled by adding dimension...

 -- getTformType (and getTformLength) methods
    Changed name to ...TFORM... and made accessible to
    other classes by giving it package level access.


In FitsFactory
  -- Added setCheckAsciiStrings flag (which defaults to false).
  If set then when a warning will be noted if invalid ASCII characters
  are found, but the program will not fail.

  -- Added ASCII charset variable.

In HeaderCard, FitsUtil, nom.tam.util.ByteParser
  -- Conversions of bytes to strings now use the FitsFactory.ASCII charset.


In Header
   -- Fixed bug with positioning of header card in positionAfterIndex

Changes to changes

In BinaryTable: didn't change getTFORMType to protected but to package
level access, since that is actual what we are using.

Did not make classes final. I can easily conceive of users wishing to extend
classes like BinaryTable to customize to their own needs.

Did not incorporate the small formatting changes.  Many of them (including
the spacing in expressions would probably be a good idea), but I've become
very wary of using the ++ and -- operators (see my contribution in the thread at
http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.java.programmer/browse_frm/thread/357b4587c4b36352/dcb152343ace64f5?lnk=gst&q=mcglynn#dcb152343ace64f5
for some of the motivation).

Did not incorporate changes to packages (not that I expected to).
