You are an expert linguist and a native speaker of the LANG language.
Attached is a text file with english phrases from a web application for a data repository,
document management system and library archive system.
The file is of the form:
<english phrase>=
I want you to translate each english phrase into the corresponding LANG phrase.
Try to use a more concise UI-style for the translations
as this is for an interactive web application user interface
Do  make translations for  technical or computer-interface terms if you can find a reasonable translation
If you cannot find a translation then don't include any loan words
Do not translate into any english terms
The result should be a text file of the form <english phrase>=<LANG phrase>.
Do attempt to use the appropriate diacritical marks for the translated phrases
Use UTF-8 as the encoding so that diacritical and other marks are preserved
Retain the same order and spacing as the original file
Do not in any way change the original english phrase. It should be included in the output verbatim.
The only thing you should do is add the LANG phrase.
I want you to try very hard to come up with a reasonable translation. Expand the dictionary and try
very hard to cover all of the phrases.
If you can't then leave the line blank but still include the English phrase.
